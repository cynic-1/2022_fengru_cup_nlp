73,1,2021/10,Eletimes,Is Chinaí»s Economic Miracle Phasing Out.,"Policymakers increasingly saw China as a threat to the world economy. China is the world’s largest growing economy currently standing at number two and it will be no magic if its GDP tops the chart and makes it number one. American Politician and the former director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe called China not only the “greatest threat to America” but also “the greatest threat to democracy and freedom worldwide since World War II. Though China does not harbor Hitler‐​style ambitions of extensive conquest, the Chinese government depends on the world economy for development and the consequent acquiescence of the Chinese people. Presently, Rather than rising to anything that could be conceived to be “dominance,” China could decline into substantial economic stagnation. It faces many problems, including the aging population, environmental devastation, slowing growth, enormous overproduction, increasing debt, and lacking foreign investments. Should we call it a complete demise or should we wait for them to rise again?Evergrande’s Domino Effect:Evergrande Real Estate currently owns more than 1,300 projects in more than 280 cities across China. The broader Evergrande Group now encompasses far more than just real estate development. Its businesses range from wealth management, making electric cars and food and drink manufacturing. It even owns one of the country’s biggest football teams – Guangzhou FC.Why is Evergrande in major trouble? Evergrande expanded aggressively to become one of China’s biggest companies by borrowing more than $300bn. Last year, Beijing brought in new rules to control the amount owed by big real estate developers.The new measures led Evergrande to offer its properties at major discounts to ensure money was coming in to keep the business afloat. Now, it is struggling to meet the interest payments on its debts. This uncertainty has seen Evergrande’s share price tumble by around 80% this year. Its bonds have also been downgraded by global credit rating agencies. Banks have reportedly declined to extend new loans to buyers of uncompleted Evergrande residential projects, while rating agencies have repeatedly downgraded the firm, citing its liquidity crunch.Some of the major foreseen effects due to this dissolution- China’s Coal CrunchChina’s coal crunch is a much bigger concern than Evergrande bankruptcy. The world’s 2nd biggest economy is all grappling with a power cut which is not only going to impact their industrial output but will be a great struggle for China’s residential people. China’s powerful state planner comes to a collision as the biggest source of power comes to a massive crunch.Looking at the domestic coal situation first, it’s clear that supply has become an issue in 2021. While the big-picture gain of 4.4% over the first eight months of the year to 2.6 billion tonnes doesn’t seem too bad, the detail shows that production has been in a downward trend for most of the year, reversing only in August. Production did recover to 335.24 million tonnes in August, but the total so far this year is still well below China’s potential output.China produced a record-high 351.89 million tonnes in December last year, as mines ramped up output to meet demand in a colder-than-expected winter. Since then, domestic production slumped to 314.17 million tonnes in July, the lowest since May 2019. Now, it is struggling and even fearing the winter season as its heat source is almost consumed and now they barely have enough to survive their manufacturing units and after that if they may have options, they would manage power cuts. Heat will be more than a luxury for China’s people this winter season.Some of the major impacts due to this crunch-How is China dominating global investment?Overseas investment offers China an opportunity to not just bolster its own economy, but also leverage its economic strength to increase its influence abroad. Driven in part by Beijing’s “Going Out” strategy and the Belt and Road Initiative, both of which encourage investment in foreign markets, Chinese firms have actively expanded their overseas footprint in a range of sectors in recent years. The Belt and Road initiative announced in 2013 aims to strengthen China’s global connectivity. As per official data for Chinese investments in the 140 countries of the Belt and Road Initiative show that overall financing and investments in the BRI in the first six months of 2021 was about US$19.3 billion. This is a decline of 32% compared to the second half of 2020 and a decline of 29% compared to the first half of 2020. It is also US$44 billion less compared to the peak in BRI financing in the second half of 2019.China’s dominating institution and cusp economy is leading countries to bail out from receiving the investment. In fact, more recently India is set to clear 45 investment proposals from China, which are likely to include those from Great Wall Motor and SAIC Motor Corp. It is evident that about 150 investment proposals from China worth more than $2 billion were stuck in the pipeline. Companies from Japan and the US routing investment through Hong Kong were also caught in the cross-fire as an inter-ministerial panel led by the interior ministry increased scrutiny of such proposals. It is not just India which is stretching their hands back but all major countries. It is happening because of China’s forever interest in disputed lands or properties and then dominating or pressurizing the countries later for their investment’s interest rates.India, Taiwan’s chip connection; erupting a volcano in China’s homeland India accelerates talks with Taiwan on a $7.5-billion chip plant. They are in talks on an agreement that could bring chip manufacturing to South Asia along with tariff reductions on components for producing semiconductors by the end of the year. This chip plant to India can supply everything from 5G devices to electric cars that too at minimal prices. India is currently studying possible locations with adequate land, water and manpower, while saying it would provide financial support of 50% of capital expenditure from 2023 as well as tax breaks and other incentives.How is India’s accelerated talk with Taiwan going to impact China’s downfall?This fresh agreement of Taiwan with India is going to impact China’s growing economy as they are already fighting the fuel crunch, increasing debt and post pandemic era and this agreement will be an add on to their existing problems. India has everything from land, to resources, to man power- everything same as China but lacks the opportunity to gain profits from such agreements. Now that we have an opportunity in our hands, it will be a step upward to beat China’s chip industry and their unsaid rivalry with India. A report said this move could be the spark that will start fresh tension with China. Here is how it built up-Now that everything is turning against China, they will have to dig some deep treasure to make the terms turn in favor of them. But the fact that the Chinese economy is so large is going to have multifold impacts on the world’s economy for each of its loopholes or unprecedented mishaps. Be its slower growth, increasing debt, energy crunch, losing investors, or sudden bankruptcy of its biggest real estate giant, everything has a domino effect on the world’s economy. Is the world going to cry on China’s demise?"
75,1,2021/10,Eletimes,Solar Energy could be Cheap and Reliable Across China by 2060,"At the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, much attention will be focused on China. As the world’s largest CO2 emitter, China’s efforts to decarbonize its energy system will be critical to the goal of limiting the rise in global average surface temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius. China has already made major commitments to transitioning its energy systems towards renewables, especially power generation from solar, wind and hydro sources. However, there are many unknowns about the future of solar energy in China, including its cost, technical feasibility, and grid compatibility in the coming decades. Recent projections of the cost of future solar energy potential in China have relied on outdated and overestimated costs of solar panels and their installation and storage technologies like lithium-ion batteries.How much will solar power really cost in China in the coming decades, including the challenges its inherent variability poses to the grid?Researchers from Harvard, Tsinghua University in Beijing, Nankai University in Tianjin and Renmin University of China in Beijing have found that solar energy could provide 43.2% of China’s electricity demands in 2060 at less than two-and-a-half U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour. For comparison, coal power tariffs in China ranged 3.6 to 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2019.“The findings highlight a crucial energy transition point, not only for China but for other countries, at which combined solar power and storage systems become a cheaper alternative to coal-fired electricity and a more grid-compatible option,” said Michael B. McElroy, the Gilbert Butler Professor of Environmental Studies at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and co-corresponding author of the study.“Today, subsidy-free solar power has become cheaper than coal power in most parts of China, and this cost-competitive advantage will soon expand to the whole country due to technology advances and cost declines,” said Xi Lu, Associate Professor, School of Environment, Tsinghua University. “Our results demonstrate that the economic competitiveness of solar power combined with investments in storage systems could provide extra benefits for grid dispatch, which will be especially important for operation of future electric systems in China.”Lu received his Ph.D. from the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and began laying groundwork for the study as a postdoctoral fellow and research associate at the SEAS-based Harvard-China Project on Energy, Economy and Environment.The research team developed an integrated model to assess solar energy potential in China and its cost from 2020-2060. The model first takes into account factors such as land uses throughout China, possible tilt and spacing of solar panels, and meteorological conditions like solar radiation and temperature to estimate the physical potential of solar power across both space and time.The team then integrated the investment costs and speed of technological changes to capture the evolving cost-competitiveness of solar power relative to coal power now and in the future. Building on this foundation, the study developed an hourly optimization model to evaluate the additional costs of power storage systems needed to smooth the variations of solar output so that it can be integrated into the grid to match electricity demand.The researchers first found that the physical potential of solar PV, which includes how many solar panels can be installed and how much solar energy they can generate, in China reached 99.2 petawatt-hours in 2020. This is more than twice the country’s total consumption of energy in all forms, including not only electricity but also fuels consumed directly by vehicles, factories, building heating and more. The findings show solar PV is an enormous resource for China’s decarbonization.They then demonstrated its cost-competitiveness, with 78.6% of the potential in 2020 equal to or lower than current prices of local coal-fired power, a share set to grow further. This cost advantage means China can invest in storage capacity, such as batteries, and still cost-effectively supply 7.2 petawatt-hours or 43.2% of country-wide electricity demand by 2060.“Most now realize that climate change requires transitioning away from fossil energy use,” said Chris P. Nielsen, executive director of the Harvard-China Project and a co-author of the paper. “Not as many realize that decarbonizing the power system is the linchpin, especially as more sectors become electrified, and that accommodation by the grid of renewable variability is the toughest part of the puzzle. It’s a huge breakthrough, and not just for China, if storage can make solar power grid-compatible at a competitive cost.”“Our research shows that if costs continue to decline, especially for storage, there could be opportunities to power vehicles, heat or cool buildings, or to produce industrial chemicals, all using solar energy. This would extend the climate and environmental benefits of solar energy far beyond the power sector as traditionally conceived,” said Shi Chen, who helped lead the study as a Tsinghua Ph.D. student and a visiting fellow at the Harvard-China Project."
74,1,2021/10,Eletimes,Shortage of Lithium-ion Batteries in Indian EV Industry,"For Indian automakers, this isn’t really turning out to be an electrifying Diwali. First, a chronic chip shortage has forced fuel-based carmakers to skip production shifts. And now, even electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are struggling to source lithium-ion batteries, prices of which are heading north even more quickly.At the heart of the supply constraint is surging global demand – and a definitive shift in favour of the EV powertrain in Western Europe and the US. Additionally, factors such as production curbs in China due to a shortage of coal-fired power and congestion in shipping routes have hurt supplies to India from its northern neighbour.China is a key supplier of lithium-ion cells to India apart from South Korea and Taiwan.Furthermore, cell manufacturers prefer supplying to markets such as the richer neighbourhoods in Europe and the US – or markets that guarantee higher volumes.To be sure, sales of EVs still remain negligible in India compared with more mature markets such as China, the US and some European countries.According to Samrath Kochar, chief executive officer of Trontek Electronics, delays of 10-15 days in shipments from China have become the norm due to a shortage of containers. His company imports cells and assembles them into battery packs for several EV makers. “In September, our procurement declined by 50%; so our supplies also went down by 50%,” Kochar told.Shipments due in September have finally arrived this month, providing some relief, but there was uncertainty on the next consignment, Kochar said.‘Need Consortium for Big Orders’
Supply constraints have also significantly raised costs. Prices of battery-grade lithium carbonate have gone up to an all-time high after increasing 27% in just two weeks to September 30, according to a report by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.Shipping costs, too, have gone through the roof. According to some estimates, the cost of shipping from China has surged four times compared with this time last year. Companies have also resorted to flying in cells through air freight in some cases to overcome shortages.All these have resulted in additional costs for EV makers. For example, Trontek has proposed a 5% increase in battery prices for its customers and hasn’t ruled out further increases.“Every time I answer the phone, the prices appear to have changed,” said Gaurav Uppal, CEO at electric motorcycles maker One Electric. Indian manufacturers need to form a consortium and place large orders to keep cell makers interested in this market, Uppal said. Else, global cell makers would route supplies to markets that guarantee volumes."
182,1,2021/10,Techradar,"Chip maker for Apple, Qualcomm, AMD warns chip shortage to last through 2022","The semiconductor shortage will definitely extend well into 2022 after the chip provider for some of the largest tech companies in the world said that production will struggle to meet the soaring demand for its products.In an online conference this week, TSMC CEO Dr. C.C. Wei said that TSMC foundry production capacity was still insufficient to satisfy the demand for its chips, especially orders for components used for high-performance computing (HPC) systems and 5G devices using the company's 5nm process node. The company's other process nodes, which are heavily used in automobiles, IoT, and server equipment, are also stretched thin according to the Taiwanese news outlet United Daily News. While TSMC is not nearly as large as Intel in terms of revenue, it has a much more diverse customer base since its chips are used by companies like Apple, AMD, Qualcomm to make everything from networking equipment to iPhones and graphics cards. Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksForge of Empires - Free Online GameIf You Like to Play, this City-Building Game is a Must-Have. No Install.Forge of Empires - Free Online GameIf TSMC is stretched thin across its most important process nodes, then a far greater number of industries are going to be impacted by the constrained capacity than if Intel were facing the same production constraints which impacts the more ""traditional"" computing market more than anything else.RECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU...In fact, even Intel is starting to contract with TSMC to make various chips and is itself starting to make chips for other companies like Amazon and Qualcomm to try and meet the global demand for semiconductor components. AMD vs Intel: which chipmaker does processors better?AMD vs Nvidia: who makes the better graphics card?We'll show you how to build a PCThe only way the chip shortage will ever be addressed, though, will be to build more foundries to increase capacity, since demand for this most essential component of modern technology is only going to increase in the future as more of everyday life becomes digitized, from smartphones to smart cities.Dr. Wei also said during the conference that the company expects to begin mass production on its 2nm process node in 2025, and the company broke ground earlier this year on a new foundry in Arizona based on its 5nm process, which is expected to be completed in 2024.Rival semiconductor fabricator Samsung, meanwhile, is in negotiations to invest $17 billion into a second semiconductor foundry in Texas, in addition to increasing investment in its current plant in Austin to boost capacity.Intel is set to spend around $20 billion to build two new foundries in Arizona and recently contracted with the US Department of Defense to build capacity for the company's most advanced node, 18A, which it expects to begin use in production starting in 2025.(Image credit: FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)The chip shortage will never go away, here's whyWhile most industry professionals will tell you that they expect the chip shortage will last into 2022, this might leave the impression that sometime in 2022, the chip shortage is going to end and that you'll be able to finally buy a PS5 or the best graphics cards that are all but vaporware right now.That's not quite what they're saying, though, since businesses project conditions out to a certain point in time to plan their business strategies, production, and inventories. Given the number of variables involved in such financial modeling, you can only really take it so far before your numbers become unreliable. That's what CEOs and such actually mean when they say the chip shortage will last through 2022.That means, in 2022, they could all show up at conferences to say that the chip shortage will last through 2023 or 2024, and honestly, that is what's going to happen unless the new reality that this chip shortage isn't a shortage at all, but a systemic deficit settles in.Chip foundries take years to build, so a number of new plants that come online in four years are going to do anything to meet the demand for chips as it currently exists. And as anyone with a cellphone that starts to degrade in performance after a couple of years can tell you, just because TSMC or Samsung fabricated the chip that runs your phone today doesn't mean that they've satisfied your demand, at least not permanently.Every couple of years, those foundries are going to have to fab all new chips to power your next phone, and the one after that. On top of that, they now also have to fab the chips that run your new Wi-Fi 6 router, and your Nest Hello doorbell, and your car. They're also going to have to build the chips to meet the demands of all the new customers they're picking up in parts of the world that had been neglected for the past twenty years in the Global South and many parts of Asia that are starting to see a booming consumer market for these goods.And that's just consumer electronics, we're not talking about all the new networking infrastructure we're going to need for the delayed 5G rollout, and then 6G when that comes around down the road.Demand is only increasing, and its growth is likely to be closer to exponential rather than linear. Adding to the number of fabrication plants isn't going to be enough to keep up when we need to be multiplying the number of plants.On top of all that, you have a physical supply chain that can disrupt production capacity at any number of points along the way, something we're seeing even with the recent port crisis in the US. All the while, demand might slow or even flatten out a bit, for a while, but it will never suddenly start declining in a way that could allow production to catch up. Intel Alder Lake release date, specs and price – everything we know"
186,1,2021/10,axios,Technology Micron to spend $150 billion on chip plants,"Memory chip maker Micron is announcing plans to spend $150 billion over the next 10 years, much of which will go to building new chip plants, potentially in the U.S.Driving the news: Micron is willing to expand in the U.S. — but wants a commitment on government funding for the chip industry.Context: Whereas the bulk of memory chips were once made in the U.S., today only about 2% of global capacity is here, with the most advanced chips coming largely from Taiwan, China and Korea. Between the lines: In making the announcement, Micron is hoping to convince Congress (as well as governments in other countries) to move forward quickly with tax incentives as the company weighs where to locate its next manufacturing plants.Micron chief strategy officer David Moore told Axios that the company is likely to locate much of its new capacity in places where it already has operations, a list that includes the U.S., but also locations throughout Asia, including Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and China.""Concentration is something we view as a risk overall to the supply chain,"" Moore said."
171,1,2021/10,Techradar,Sony and TSMC may team up to tackle global chip shortages,"Taiwanese tech powerhouse TSMC and Japan’s giant Sony are reportedly joining forces to build a chip factory in the latter’s home country. According to Nikkei reports, the two companies, together with several other partners (including the Japanese government) want to try and alleviate some of the pressure created by the acute chip shortage that came as a side-effect of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as creating a contingency plan in case China makes any sudden moves against Taiwan.The factory would cost approximately $7 billion, with the Japanese government allegedly interested in covering half of the expenses. TSMC would have majority control, while Sony would provide the real estate needed to build the factory.

123,1,2021/10,Eetasia,"Intel Rules Out Fab Investment in UK, Blaming Brexit","Intel has officially ruled out the UK as the site for its planned huge expansion of chip manufacturing capability in Europe, blaming the country’s choice to leave the European Union (EU) for its decision.Pat Gelsinger, the American semiconductor giant’s CEO told the BBC Thursday (Oct. 7, 2021) that “post Brexit, we are looking to the EU countries and getting support from the EU”.The announcement is a huge blow to the UK’s manufacturing capability, coming just a day after Boris Johnson, the country’s Prime Minister, said he is targeting the UK to become a “science and technology superpower”.Gelsinger revealed earlier this year that Intel was planning to invest €80 billion in building new fabs or expanding existing facilities over the next 10 years, as well as hugely increasing capacity in the US.He told the BBC, “I have no idea whether we would have had a superior site from the UK. But we now have 70 proposals for sites across Europe from maybe ten different countries. We are hopeful we will get agreement on a site, as well as support from the EU […] before the end of this year”.It is understood sites in France, Poland, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are the most likely to get the nod, as well as extending its facility in Leixlip, County Kildare, Ireland.The UK Government launched its Build Back Better for growth strategy last March, so the decision and rebuff is a significant blow to Johnson’s plans.For many years, the UK was seen as one of the most favourable gateways to Europe for US and Asian countries. But Intel clearly considers the country no longer has a sustainable supply chain resilience, nor can it any longer guarantee free cross-border trade.Gelsinger also bemoaned the current state of the global semiconductor industry, stressing “just about everything is short right now. And even as I and my peers in the industry are working like crazy to catch up, it’s going to be a while”.He opined the supply situation would “incrementally” improve next year and is not likely to stabilize until 2023, but that the current chip crisis is likely to last until Christmas. “There is some possibility that there may be a few IOUs [I Owe You] around the Christmas trees around the world this year,” he quipped.Gelsinger also stressed the company was expecting to secure state subsidies in both Europe and the US, since both have become over-reliant on Asian countries for much of their semiconductor needs. Some two-thirds of the world’s chips are currently produced in Taiwan and South Korea, where semiconductor manufacturing is significantly cheaper.The EU is hoping to double its share of global chip fabrication, from the current low of about 10% to nearer 20% and it probably needs at least one of the top three of TSMC, Samsung or Intel in order to achieve this.The European project is a significant plank in Gelsinger’s ambitious strategy, dubbed IDM 2.0, which envisions an updated version of Intel’s integrated business model. It would see the company not only designing and assembling its own chips, but also offer contract manufacturing operations for other semiconductor suppliers.It would also bolster the existing cluster of expertise in chip manufacturing in Europe at companies such as ASML in the Netherlands and Zeiss in Germany, as well as the Continent’s highly rated research outfits like IMEC in Belgium, CEA-Leti in France and the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany.This article was originally published on EE Times Europe."
78,1,2021/10,Eletimes,India-Taiwan Bargaining í░Chipí▒ can Cripple Chinese Dominance,"Technology and electronics are running the economic and development wheel of the world and Semiconductors are the fuel on which Modern electronics and technology run. From highly sophisticated space station equipment and military-grade weapons and technologies to the desktop or mobile phone on which you must be reading this, every electronic device is fundamentally operating on a chip or a semiconductor. Semiconductors are the cornerstone of everyday electronics and technology.India’s electronics market is one of the largest in the world in terms of consumption. It is likely to grow to USD 400 billion by 2025. While India is one of the largest consumers of electronic devices, it is very sad to know that every chip that is being used in those devices is being imported from elsewhere. Industry experts have been addressing the need for India to become a completely self-reliant manufacturing hub of the world. Furthermore, the perpetual growth and advances in the technological realm and the related industries has expanded the dependency on semiconductor research and escalated the economic value of its manufacturing capacity. It’s not an overstatement to say that semiconductors have powered the modern world.India has done well in design and verification for the semiconductor industry, with most of the global semiconductor companies having an R&D footprint in India, but 100% of our chips, memory and display are imported into the country. Just on semiconductor chips alone, we are probably looking at around $10-12 billion of imports this year at a minimum. Not only this, there has been an already ongoing shortage of chips across the globe, and the recent pandemics and consequent lockdowns in almost every country have brought industries to their knees.To boost the Indian economy, India amongst several other steps, very boldly invited the world’s top chip players to set up their foundries in the motherland. However, there has been a sentiment of over-optimism going around as this is perhaps the third time in the last decade when this bubble has appeared. But, Things might be pointing towards the ‘third time’s charm’ now. Because things are on a positive track this time with Taiwan TSMC, the world’s largest advanced chip manufacturer.TSMC, which powers smartphone chips for Apple, MediaTek, Qualcomm and others, has grown its market share to 56 per cent within the semiconductor contract manufacturer market, according to reports in the first quarter, far surpassing Samsung (18 per cent), United Microelectronics Corporation (7 per cent) and GlobalFoundries (7 per cent).India and Taiwan are in talks on an agreement that could lead to setting up a chip manufacturing unit in South Asia along with tariff reductions on components for producing semiconductors by the end of the year, people familiar with the matter said. This can reduce the dependency on China for countries like the USA, Japan and South Korea as well and it can also lead to diversifying crucial supply-chains networks. Despite its tiny size, the GDP of Taiwan is over 600 billion- dollars which is twice the size of Pakistan’s economy.Officials in New Delhi and Taipei have met in recent weeks to discuss a deal that would bring a chip plant worth an estimated $7.5 billion to India to supply everything from 5G devices to electric cars. India is currently studying possible locations with adequate land, water and manpower while saying it would provide financial support of 50% of capital expenditure from 2023 as well as tax breaks and other incentives.Taiwanese extended branch to bolster economic relations with India is hampered by a host of factors. These include complicated tax regulations (which could be somewhat ameliorated by India’s new goods and services tax regime), corruption, insufficient understanding of each other’s investment environments and markets, cost-inflated high-skill services like business consulting, and linguistic and cultural differences.The trade talks come at a time when democracies across the world are boosting economic and military links to stand up against an increasingly assertive China. While Taiwan has long sought a trade deal with India, officials in New Delhi had been hesitant to anger Beijing, which claims the island democracy as its territory.India has sought to lure high-technology investments as it seeks to become more self-reliant on chips, while Taiwan wants to strengthen its diplomatic presence around the globe as it pushes back against the pressure from China. Beijing has vowed to work toward unifying the island democracy with the mainland, even by force if necessary.Chip shortages have delayed the much-anticipated launch of a smartphone by billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries that has been co-engineered with Google. Currently, India imports almost all semiconductors to meet demand estimated to reach around $100 billion by 2025 from about $24 billion now.Taiwan has welcomed cooperation between the two sides on semiconductors although it is still evaluating the proposal given a lack of ecosystem for setting up a chip fabrication plant in India, people familiar with the matter said. The Taiwan side has flagged concerns on the supply of water and electricity and suggested that it may be more feasible for India to start creating a chip design sector first before proceeding to build fabs.In February 2019, the Indian government announced the National Electronic Policy 2019, which aims to achieve the target of $400 billion in Indian domestic demand for electronics hardware by 2025, rather than the earlier goal of doing so by 2020. This means several things: for starters, it shows that the current annual growth rate for domestic production (26.7 per cent) has fallen below the targeted growth rate over this time period (2009–2020). Given current levels of domestic production (approximately $59 billion in 2017–2018), India’s capacity to produce electronics hardware does not appear to be on pace to meet the 2010 goal of reaching more than $100 billion by 2020. Beyond that, growth in India’s domestic demand has not yet closed in on the earlier $400 billion targets either, a benchmark also targeted originally for 2020. This implies that it will take longer than anticipated for Indian domestic production to meet the nominal 2020 targets unless the momentum of growth is scaled up drastically (which seems highly unlikely). This only reinforces India’s need for solid partnerships with actors like Taiwan to help meet the production shortfall, and the country’s need for targeted exports in this sector, given that overall market demand is projected to grow exponentially in the coming years.The growing demand in India for electronics hardware complements Taiwan’s comparative advantages and goals of boosting domestic firms and spurring economic growth. Taiwan’s electronics sector accounts for 15.5 per cent of the island’s GDP, while India’s amounts to only 1.7 per cent of its overall GDP. India’s aggregate production of electronics hardware in 2014–2015 was in the range of $32.5 billion, whereas domestic consumption was nearly double that figure; over that period, imports accounted for around 58 per cent of Indian consumption of electronics hardware.Taiwan is a tiny island located in the south-east of China, and the government of Taiwan claims itself to be a ‘Republic of china’, and alleges the Communist Party of China for the forceful occupation of China mainland. The footprints of all the globally acknowledged tensions and controversies of Taiwan can be mapped to the Chinese Civil War and since then the government of the Republic of China has been ruling the island from its capital Taipei. The increasing influence of communist China has almost isolated Taiwan and currently, only 23 smaller countries from the Pacific, Africa and Latin America enjoy diplomatic relations with Taipei. In Spite of that, the USA is still the biggest ally of Taiwan, but that too may be a strategic decision to uplift US bargaining chips against China.On several occasions, China has sternly warned other nations to stay clear of the Taiwan issue. In fact, in May 2021. The Chinese state media Global Times publicly warned Australia to enter Taiwan with retaliatory missiles. To China, Taiwan is an inalienable part of its territory, and China has been relentlessly ramping up campaigns for years to try to persuade businesses and countries alike to accept Taiwan as part of mainland China.You can Change Friends, not Neighbours”After the 1962 Sino-Indian war, India lost initial hopes of good relations with its largest neighbour and became sceptical towards China since then. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and India faced the BOP crises, India came up with the “Look East Policy” seeking improved relations with East Asian Countries. This policy also gave a diplomatic push to the Dormant India-Taiwan relations as well, and henceforth India-Taiwan relations have been on a growth curve. The “Bilateral Investment Agreement” in 2002 was the result of that, which led to direct air connectivity between India and Taiwan. Another significant incident happened in 2021, which boosted this relation when Beijing refused to give a visa to a Kashmir based Indian military commander, which questioned the sovereignty of India, and in response to that India decided to suspend its military ties with China and explosively affirmed China to acknowledge ‘One India Policy’.After this incident, the visits between India and Taiwan extended to formal relations. Taiwan hosted the then president of India, APJ Abdul Kalam in 2010. The “Southbound Policy” of 2016 of Taiwan has emphasised good relations with ASEAN and South-Asian countries. The 2020 Galwan crisis with China also acted as a catalyst in strengthening the relations between India and Taiwan, when Taipei criticised the Chinese aggression that happened in Galwan and urged other countries to extend support to India.The economic angle between India-Taiwan relations is perhaps one of the most important aspects of this relation. During 2002-2014, Taiwan invested 66 million dollars in India, but in comparison to that, from 2021 the total investment increased rapidly. Taiwanese company Foxconn has invested 5 billion dollars in India. The India- Taiwan bilateral trade was nearly $6 billion in 2016 with 140 Taiwanese companies operating in India. India also acknowledges the extended support from Taiwan recently by providing medical assistance to help India fight the COVID outbreak.Sealing this deal with Taiwan can be a portrayal of India’s stern and firm approach towards China and the propelling tensions by overlooking the ‘One China Policy’, anymore. If all goes well, then for India this deal would be one of the biggest game-changer and it will boost the Indian economy to reach the 1 trillion dollar mark, perhaps sooner than is expected.Mayank Vashisht | Sub Editor | ELE Times"

TOKYO — As the lines begin to blur between cloud and edge computing, NXP Semiconductors is racing to offer the highest performance SoC of the company’s Layerscape family. 
The new chip, LX2160A, can offload heavy-duty computing done at data centers in the cloud, enabling the middle of the network —  typically, service operators — to execute network virtualization and run high-performance network applications on network equipment such as base stations. 
Toby Foster, senior product manager for NXP, told us that his team developed the new high-performance chip with three goals in mind. They sought first to enable new types of virtualization in the network, second to achieve new heights of integration and performance at low power featuring next-generation I/Os, and third, to double the scale of virtual network functions and crypto, compared to NXP’s previous Layerscape SoC (LS2088A), while maintaining low power consumption. [Download] Net common resistance extraction is crucial to design reliability   
Specifically, the LX2160A features 16 high-performance ARM Cortex-A72 cores running at over 2 GHz at 20- to 30-watt. It supports both the 100 Gbit/s Ethernet and PCIe Gen4 interconnect standards.
 Why edge computing? The industry, including NXP, tends to view edge processing as the driver for the next phase of networking, computing and IoT infrastructure growth.  By moving workloads from the cloud to the edge, operators will suffer less latency while gaining resiliency and bandwidth reliability, explained Foster.
Bob Wheeler, principal analyst responsible for networking at the Linley Group, told us, “In some cases, such as content delivery networks, the transition from the cloud to the edge is already happening.” He predicted, “Mobile edge computing will primarily happen in conjunction with 5G rollouts starting in 2019.”

358,4,2017/10,Eletimes,Understanding and Embracing the Era of Embedded Computing,"The exponential growth and advancements in the field of electronics, wireless communications, networking, cognitive and affective computing and robotic devices are helping human beings communicate in more ways than ever imagined. IoT has been shaping the future of many industries, and has been contributing to their growth by generating an unprecedented amount of data. This exponential growth in the Internet of Things (IOT) technology puts the impact of embedded computing in the technology industry, in perspective. The Internet of Things (IoT) essentially refers to an ecosystem of discrete computing devices with sensors connected through the infrastructure of the Internet (Information Age). These discrete computing devices that perform independent functions and yet integrate as a system in achieving a shared goal, form the crux of embedded systems.The embedded systems industry was born with the invention of micro-controllers and since then it has evolved into various forms, from primarily being designed for machine control applications to various other new verticals with the convergence of communications. In the early 1960s, development of embedded systems began and since then it has grown exponentially in terms of power as well as functionality. Due to the large scale proliferation of integrated chips and other related parts, costs of such systems have also come down drastically.Since then, the world has witnessed the impact of embedded circuits in tackling complex issues pertaining to bind the physical and computational world. Many of these solutions have been in the form of portable, embedded or wearable devices and systems while others have been distributed, decentralized and massively networked. A System on Chip (SoC) technology embodies and symbolizes much of these advances. It comprises several cooperating, interacting, and potentially heterogeneous hardware/firmware/software sub-systems.Embedded systems are the cornerstone of the electronics industry today. Embedded systems are used in almost all the areas like consumer, cooking, industrial, automotive, medical, commercial and military applications. Its important characteristics are low-power, real-time responsiveness, low thermal dissipation, small physical form factor/footprint, low radiation/emission, ruggedness in design and to protection from external radiations to name a few.In order to achieve key requirements, embedded systems are generally restricted to limited resources in terms of computing, memory, display size etc. With the continued convergence of other technologies, many more functionalities that were once part of traditional computing platforms are being pushed into embedded devices. This further adds a major “decision challenge” for architects and product managers regarding the selection of processors, operating systems, and standards of usage.As per a recent report published by Allied Market Research titled, “World Embedded Computing Market” the world embedded computing market is likely to generate revenue of $236.5 billion by 2022, with an estimated CAGR of 6.2% from 2016 to 2022. In the year 2015, North America was the highest revenue-generating region owing to the high adoption of technology, higher standards of living, and the presence of dominant market players. The Asia-Pacific region was the second largest market, in terms of revenue generation, and is expected to obtain a dominant position during the forecast period. Major factors that boost the demand of embedded computing systems in the Asia-Pacific region include increasing adoption of technology, declining prices of consumer electronics, and improving living standards in countries such India and China.While the ever-decreasing costs of embedded computing hardware is expected and not too exciting, there have been a few key price points that are an indicator of things to come. The most well-known is the Raspberry Pi Zero, created by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, will continue to push this impressive level of development capability into schools, really giving the next generation of engineers (and non-engineers) some hands-on experience. Perhaps a lesser- known release is C.H.I.P, the new development platform from Next Thing Co. The hardware is like the Pi Zero, but the drive behind the company is quite different.We are surrounded by various classes of embedded systems such as home media systems, portable players, smart phones, embedded medical devices and sensors, automotive embedded systems. With the continued convergence of communications and computing functions within these devices, embedded systems are transforming themselves into really complex systems like hybrid vehicles, MRI, and avionics.The growth of wireless communication infrastructure is the key driver for the expansion of this market. The increasing penetration of smartphones and tablets has resulted in the development of wireless communication infrastructure. Since embedded computers are an important component of telecom devices, their usage in sectors like telecom and transport is expected to result in market growth during the forecast period.The global market for embedded computers is positively affected by the technology’s increasing application in sectors like transportation, energy, telecom, and medical technology. The widespread applicability of embedded computers in different end-user segments is expected to result in its healthy CAGR of more than 14% by 2019. This market is fragmented and contains multiple local and multinational vendors. Recently, it has been observed that the presence of limited target customers in this market is intensifying the competition amongst vendors. This is expected to generate a price war, which will lower the bargaining power of vendors.The digital revolution has now reached a stage where we cannot conduct our normal modern daily lives without this technology. Indeed, it is reasonable to say that everyone already owns at least one device, which contains a processor or microcontroller in it whether it is a phone, a television, an automatic washing machine, an MP3 player, or microwave oven.We are on the horizon of some exciting advancements in the field of embedded computing. The Global Embedded Computing Market Research Report 2017 offers deep insights into the status of key regional markets in the Embedded Computing Industry on a global level, focusing primarily on the core regions including continents like Europe, North America, and Asia and the key countries such as United States, Germany, China and Japan. In addition to seeing an ever-growing number of IoT and smart devices, it can be concluded that during the next few years we’ll see embedded computing enable great advancements in AI and smart cities. Backyard developers will be empowered to create more impressive and advanced systems, and technical literacy will become more widespread. Needless to say, the scope and reach of embedded computing and IOT is crossing leaps and bounds towards an exciting future."

502,5,2018/02,RCR,How prepared is the telecom industry to deploy NSA 5G NR.,"Now that there’s a non-standalone 5G NR standard in place, how has the rest of the telecom industry aligned to support promised commercial rollouts as early as the second half of 2018? Serge Willenegger, Qualcomm SVP and GM of 4G/5G and Industrial IoT took stock during a recent media and analyst event at the company’s San Diego headquarters.“The bottomline is…5G, as we have it defined in the first wave, is very relevant to trends we’re seeing in the consumer space. We’re pretty confident that the adoption is going to come as soon as we put this capability in the hands of the user and the ecosystem around it.  We have use case, we have network, we have silicon, we will have devices.”In December the 3GPP finalized the non-standalone 5G NR standard, which uses the LTE core and radio networks along with a 5G carrier. When the standard-setting body adopted the standard at a meeting in Portugal, TSG RAN Chairman Balazs Bertenyi described the non-standalone variant as the “first drop” of the complete 5G NR standard and described it as “primarily guided by the early adopters, by the early deployment plans of operators in different regions and those early deployment plans really call for a mobile broadband boost.” 5G contemplates three primary use cases, and Bertenyi called out the one poised to come to market first–enhanced mobile broadband. The other two primary use cases are massive support for the internet of things and mission critical communications that take advantage of the ultra-low-latency and high-capacity 5G will provide. Ahead of 5G, operators are deploying LTE Advanced Pro features to provide gigabit-class LTE networks; this will provide a surround for early 5G deployments so users can have a relatively consistent experience as they move in and out of 5G hot spots.To get an idea of the vendor excitement around the prospect of starting to sell 5G NR equipment at scale, consider that in the little more than a month since 3GPP’s Dec. 21 adoption, both Ericsson and Nokia have announced end-to-end product support.Nokia’s Future X architecture, along with ReefShark chipsets, will support early operator deployments, as will Ericsson’s new release, which also notes that Ericsson equipment made from 2015 and forward can be upgraded to NSA 5G NR with a software installation.Qualcomm announced this week that its X50 modem will be used by more than a dozen device OEMs to bring the smartphone piece of the 5G equation to reality. This month the X50 modem supported 4.51 Gbps throughput using a millimeter wave radio link.Those OEMs are: ASUS, Fujitsu, hmd, HTC, Inseego, LG, NetComm Wireless, Netgear, OPPO, Sharp, Sierra Wireless, Sony, Telit, Vivo, WNC, Wingtech, mi and ZTE.Qualcomm is also working with a broad range of carrier partners on commercializing NSA 5G NR: AT&T, BT, China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom, Deutsche Telekom, KDDI, KT, LGU+, NTT DoCoMo, Orange, SingTel, SK Telecom, Sprint, Telstra, TIM, Verizon and Vodafone Group."
585,5,2018/02,RCR,ZTE launches end-to-end 5G network slicing solution,"ZTE has released what it claims to be the world’s first end-to-end 5G network slicing solution. ZTE highlighted solution is the key to the 5G network as it allows the resource of a physical network to be flexibly allocated into multiple virtualized network slices in order to adapt to the needs of different industrial services, such as industrial control, automatic driving, intelligent power grid and remote medical treatment.ZTE’s solution is an end-to-end, all cloud-based network slicing solution across 5G radio access network, core network and bearer network. The solution is based on a micro-service architecture and realizes the convergence of the unified air interface, the virtualized core network and the SDN-based bearer network.“The release of the 5G E2E network slicing solution is a key milestone towards the 5G commercialization. It not only provides an industrial leading implementation method of network slice, but also turns the network slice into an operational and valuable product for the vertical industry, inaugurating a new mode of the 5G network slice operation,” said You Yan, vice president at ZTE.ZTE is currently investing approximately $500 million per year in 5G research. The vendor has a team of more than 4,500 technicians devoted to 5G research.In 2017, ZTE partnered with over 20 mobile operators globally to carry out collaborations in the 5G field. These agreements included a deal with China Mobile to launch China’s first 5G pre-commercial base station. During 2017, ZTE also initiated a 5G field test with Japan’s SoftBank.The vendor has already launched a series of products for 5G commercial applications, including a 5G series of access equipment, diversified 5G bearing solutions, as well as a flexible 5G core networkIn related 5G news, Verizon, Samsung Electronics and Korean telecommunications firm KT have carried out a demonstration of Samsung 5G solutions and use cases, including a prototype 5G tablet device, and a live video call conducted over 5G between Minneapolis, US and Seoul, Korea.The involved firms said that the 5G international video connection, which featured Samsung’s 5G end-to-end (E2E) solutions in each location, served as an example of how use of commercial 5G mobile devices and connectivity is growing closer to reality.“By working closely with industry leaders like KT and Samsung, we are finally making 5G a reality,” said Ed Chan, SVP and chief technology architect, at Verizon. “Seeing Samsung’s 5G end-to-end solutions in action, including a working prototype 5G tablet, underscores how important our collaborative relationship has been in helping accelerate the availability of commercial 5G mobility for customers.”Samsung enabled the demonstration of 5G experiences by supplying network Infrastructure composed of 28GHz 5G access units, 5G home routers, virtualized RAN and virtualized core network, as well as the prototype 5G device. The proto-type tablet is capable of supporting data session handovers between 4G LTE and 5G and demonstrates advancements in chipset and antenna technology required to support future commercial devices.The three companies have been working on 5G research and development since 2015."
516,5,2018/02,RCR,How 5G NR interoperability testing is shaping commercialization,"With the non-standalone 5G New Radio (NR) specification approved by 3GPP in December 2017, the telecom ecosystem is rapidly conducting standard-compliant interoperability testing to prepare for commercialization as soon as the second-half of this year. The non-standalone 5G NR standard uses the LTE core and RAN with the addition to 5G component carrier whereas standalone 5G NR, set for standardization in June, has a new core and RAN.Early spec-based 5G deployments will leverage LTE investments to provide primarily enhanced mobile broadband services, as well as support for the booming internet of things. Once the standard was adopted at a meeting in Lisbon, Portugal, operators, vendors and device OEMs immediately got to work on interoperability testing to help ensure a rapid commercialization that can help them begin to return on the massive, and ongoing, investment in 5G. Let’s take a look at recent global 5G NR interoperability testing.Earlier this month, inside a Nokia facility in Murray Hill, N.J., the network infrastructure vendor worked with Verizon and Qualcomm to complete what is being billed as the first over-the-air call based on 3GPP’s non-standalone 5G New Radio specification and using licensed millimeter wave spectrum.Verizon, based on its acquisition of licenses previously held by XO Communications, has licensed millimeter wave spectrum holdings in the 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands. This test used 28 GHz spectrum, according to Verizon spokesman John O’Malley, and transmitted a 4K video stream. “With the bandwidth 5G provides on millimeter wave spectrum, we felt 4K video was the best application to showcase the technology versus an over-the-top voice call,” O’Malley said in a statement to RCR Wireless News.On the network side, the test used a Nokia AirScale baseband and radio, AirFrame server and AirScale Cloud RAN equipped with standard-compliant software. Qualcomm provided a prototype smartphone form factor device that supports millimeter wave spectrum, which the chipmaker debuted in September 2017.Verizon is planning to offer a standard-compliant 5G commercial service later this year. Building on tests conducted throughout 2017, Verizon is targeting the second half of this year to use fixed wireless to provide a residential enhanced mobile broadband service. Plans call for an initial deployment in Sacramento, Calif., with additional deployments in two to four more markets.As China’s state-owned telecom giants race to deploy 5G in the C-band spectrum (4 to 8 GHz), equipment-maker Huawei said in January it has completed the world’s first 5G NR interoperability and development testing based on the Release 15 standard with a commercial base station. The company said the test was based on the largest C-band cell bandwidth defined by the 5G NR standard.Huawei said it has been working on 5G with T-Mobile US parent Deutsche Telekom since 2015. In this test, its commercial 5G New Radio base station was used with Intel’s 5G New Radio mobile trial platform. Intel, Huawei and DT say they have jointly verified the fundamentals of the new 5G 3GPP NR standard, including new synchronization, coding, frame structure, and numerology components underlying the interconnection of the NR-compliant terminal and network.Intel VP Asha Keddy, the company’s VP for next generation and standards, said network testing in China typically occurs on a much bigger scale than in North America, with many trials addressing hundreds of sites. She expects China to roll out 5G in two rounds, first in the C-band and then in the millimeter wave bands that the North American operators are testing now.“China has publicly said it will be a world leader,” said Keddy, “The Chinese government has been very clear they want to lead.”Gearing up for larger-scale trials later this year, South Korean operator KT, working with compatriot network and device OEM and San Diego-based Qualcomm, is testing 5G NR in the 3.5 GHz and 28 GHz bands; the former is seen as a key global 5G roaming band, while the latter millimeter wave frequencies provides massive, hot spot-type capacity.Over-the-air testing, based on KT’s spectrum, Samsung base stations and prototype user equipment from Qualcomm, achieved multi-gigabit-per-second data throughput, according to KT.“This 5G NR trial will pave the way to a successful launch of 5G NR networks and mobile devices, which will market another technology breakthrough,” KT EVP and Head of Networking Strategy Seo Chang-Seok said. Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon added, “As the industry works toward the goal of commercial launches of 5G NR products and networks in 2019, close collaboration among global mobile industry leaders on testing and successful trials are necessary to validate the technologies and continue to build and improve our capabilities.”     "
504,5,2018/02,RCR,Ericsson releases spec-compliant 5G NR platform,"In December 2017, 3GPP finalized the non-standalone 5G New Radio (NR) specification, which uses the LTE radio and core network in tandem with a new 5G carriers. The standalone 5G NR specification, set to be finalized in mid-2018, will establish a new 5G NR core network. Operators eager to deploy a 5G service in 2019 are focused on NSA 5G NR and, as such, network infrastructure vendors worked quickly to release spec-compliant equipment following approval of the non-standalone standard.On Jan. 29 Nokia announced its Future X architecture, along with new chipsets, which includes updates to core, transport, radio and silicon products. Now, in the run-up to Mobile World Congress 2018, Nokia rival Ericsson is previewing its 5G NR platforms, which includes core, radio and software.Given the R&D spend that has gone into 5G, coupled with waning investment in LTE equipment and market share loss in mainland China, vendors and operator partners are eager to commercialize 5G services. NSA 5G NR compatible silicon and network infrastructure are ready to go, and device availability is expected in 2019, which highlights the desire for rapid network deployments. To facilitate this, Ericsson radio equipment from 2015 and forward can be updated to support 5G NR through an over-the-air software installation, which has big implications for time-to-market.“There is no need to rip and replace,” Ericsson EVP and Head of Business Area Networks Fredrik Jejdling said. “We have a long history of strong backwards compatibility and our products and software are built for evolution…Investments in Ericsson Radio System since 2015 will continue to bring operators value when the time is right to transition to 5G. Swisscom Head of Joint Mobile Group Daniel Staub said, “We can launch 5G services more efficiently…significantly boosting the long-term value of our network assets.”To support network densification efforts and complement its macro and micro cell offerings, Ericsson announced what it calls the “Street Macro…These radios will be on building facades with a smaller footprint but the necessary strength to secure network efficiency and coverage.”Ericsson also announced radios that support massive multiple-input, multiple-out (MIMO), which it has tested out with Sprint, which sees massive MIMO as central to its 5G plans.Furthermore, the company unveils new radio products supporting Massive MIMO technology. These products enable a smooth evolution from 4G to 5G and address the need for increased capacity, while simplifying use for wider adoption.  "

670,6,2018/10,axios,Technology Tim Cook calls out Bloomberg News to retract Chinese spy chip piece,"Apple CEO Tim Cook denied allegations that the company fell victim to a hardware-based attack carried out by the Chinese government, and called on the publication, Bloomberg, to retract the story, according to an interview with BuzzFeed News.Why it matters: This is the first time Apple has called for a retraction of a news article based on the contents written about the company. Buzzfeed also details the Apple CEO's frustration with the publication, as Cook claims Bloomberg has ignored their accounts. “We turned the company upside down. Email searches, data center records, financial records, shipment records. We really forensically whipped through the company to dig very deep and each time we came back to the same conclusion: This did not happen. There's no truth to this.”— Apple CEO Tim Cook to Buzzfeed NewsSince Bloomberg's piece: Apple has sent a comment to Bloomberg to be included in the published piece claiming the story is inaccurate, that Apple has never found malicious chips and has not had any contact with the FBI regarding the subject matter.The tech company wrote an adamant and detailed company statement after the piece was published explaining each statement Apple claims as false. Apple sent a letter to U.S. Congress signed by its vice president of information security, George Stathakopoulos, that said the company is ""eager"" to share its side of the story, and if the story was true, ""it would rightly raise grave concerns.""Go deeper: Go deeper: Bloomberg's fraying ""secret chips"" storyScoop: Apple ratchets up denial on Bloomberg storyBloomberg: China bugged ethernet hardware, too"
666,6,2018/10,axios,World China reportedly spied on U.S. companies through secret microchips,"Amazon and Apple network servers may have been compromised by Chinese spy microchips, a Bloomberg Businessweek report claims.What happened: U.S. investigators found that microchips were installed in servers used by various companies while they were being manufactured in China. The goal, per Bloomberg, was ""long-term access to high-value corporate secrets and sensitive government networks.""The details: The discovery kicked off a government investigation which, after three years, is still going. No consumer data is believed to be compromised from the almost 30 companies that were affected.Supermicro, the U.S.-based company that assembles the affected servers, dominates the industry. While it assembles its products in the U.S., its core product, the motherboards, are manufactured in China. A former U.S. intelligence official told Bloomberg that attacking Supermicro ""is like attacking Windows. It's like attacking the whole world."" The other side: Amazon, Apple, and Supermicro all disputed the findings of Bloomberg's report.Read the responses that each company provided to Bloomberg.Amazon said in a release on Thursday: ""At no time, past or present, have we ever found any issues relating to modified hardware or malicious chips in SuperMicro motherboards in any Elemental or Amazon systems. ...

665,6,2018/10,axios,World Mike Pence. .China wants a different American President.,"Vice President Mike Pence will lay out the Trump administration's case that China is ""meddling in America’s democracy"" in a speech this morning, according to excerpts of his prepared remarks.What to watch: Axios' Jonathan Swan reported recently that the Trump administration was planning an ""administration-wide"" anti-China campaign. This is part of that ongoing effort.Why it matters: President Trump raised eyebrows by declaring last week, without offering evidence, that China was meddling in the midterms. Pence is attempting to put meat on those bones, while laying out a broader case that Beijing is a threat to U.S. interests and a destabilizing force around the world. He'll also make an explicit comparison to Russian interference, saying: ""What the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what [China] is doing across this country.""Between the lines: This speech comes on a headline-packed day when it comes to Russian and Chinese hacking and intelligence activities. Russian spies attempted to hack the Netherlands-based global chemical weapons watchdog investigating the poisoning of ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and were subsequently kicked out of the country, Dutch authorities announced this morning. The Department of Justice then issued indictments against 7 Russian intelligence officers.Bloomberg reports that China used tiny microchips, installed in servers of some of America's largest companies, in an attempt to gain ""long-term access to high-value corporate secrets and sensitive government networks.""The big picture: Pence's speech matches warnings from intelligence officials and other experts that China is ramping up its intelligence activities and influence operations around the world. On election interference, though, Pence's case is less clear cut. He cites as an example of election interference the fact that China targeted tariffs at key midterm election states — the European Union and others did the same thing.Go deeper ...

664,6,2018/10,axios,"Technology Bloomberg. China bugged ethernet hardware, too","Following up on its controversial story accusing China of implanting chips into Supermicro server motherboards to spy on companies, Bloomberg now reports that a researcher found a different implant in an unnamed company's Supermicro system.The details:  Yossi Appleboum, co-CEO of Sepio Systems, claims to have found a hardware implant in the ""ethernet connector"" of a telecom company's Supermicro motherboard in August. He could not reveal to Bloomberg what company he found the implant in due to a non-disclosure agreement. The backdrop: Bloomberg's first story took flack after Homeland Security, the British cybersecurity agency NCSC, and the companies it named — Supermicro, Apple and Amazon — all denied the story. What the new story means: The latest story provides a new data point that Supermicro systems were involved in espionage. That provides some general support for the first story. It does not show evidence the implant in the first story existed, or that any of the narratives arround Apple and Amazon discovering that first implant in the first story were true. The new story is based on the experiences of a single person and the secrecy around the target makes it hard for a third party to verify. ""This would makes more sense in firmware than hardware,"" tweeted former NSA hacker Jake Williams, the founder of Rendition Infosec. It matters whether the spying tool is hardware or firmware. Firmware, the code embedded in physical devices, is easier to replace than hardware. And it's more likely that spies could tamper with firmware without the cooperation of a company like Supermicro than that they could slip a chip into the assembly of a motherboard."
663,6,2018/10,axios,Technology Go deeper. Bloomberg's fraying .secret chips. story,"Last Thursday Bloomberg reported that authorities were investigating Supermicro, which manufactures server motherboards, for shipping equipment implanted with chips that China could use to spy on users. The big picture: The piece was a bombshell, but a raft of vehement denials from everyone involved — including Apple and Amazon, which Bloomberg claimed discovered the secret chips in their own servers — has made the story increasingly hard to believe. Why it matters: If the piece is a mistake, it is not a small one. Shares in Supermicro stock dropped more than 50% after the story, wiping away nearly $600 million in market cap. But this isn’t just about one firm’s fortunes — the kind of sabotage described in the story, if real, could compromise major institutions. Supermicro products — and the web and cloud services fueled by them — are used by defense, banks, hospitals and other groups.A state election official who spoke to Codebook was concerned that state accounts might have been made vulnerable to attack.It's hard to believe that Amazon, Apple and Supermicro are all fabricating their emphatic denials of the Bloomberg story. Some users dismissed the denials on Twitter, declaring “I can’t trust corporations” — a distrust that many tech companies have brought upon themselves.But lawyers who spoke to Codebook said the detailed denials wouldn’t just be a public relations issue if incorrect or fudged. “The companies [would] risk enforcement by the FTC for engaging in a deceptive act that is likely to harm consumers,” emailed David Vladeck, Georgetown professor and former head of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, adding, “I am strongly disinclined to think they are lying.”Apple would only have compounded its woes Monday by repeating its claims in a letter to two congressional committees. Homeland Security and the British cybersecurity office, the National Cyber Security Centre also denied knowledge of Bloomberg’s claims. The big question: Flustered cybersecurity pros have been left wondering how much of the story is accurate. The expert consensus is that it's more likely that Bloomberg is wrong than that the companies and government agencies are lying. One key voice disapproving of the piece is security researcher Joe FitzPatrick, who is quoted in the story. According to the Risky Business podcast, FitzPatrick says he emailed Bloomberg before the article was published that their story ""didn't make sense.""Bloomberg noted in a statement sent to Codebook Tuesday that Joe FitzPatrick had no direct knowledge that the story was incorrect. ""The specific ways the implant worked were described, confirmed, and elaborated on by our primary sources who have direct knowledge of the compromised Supermicro hardware. Joe FitzPatrick was not one of these 17 individual primary sources that included company insiders and government officials, and his direct quote in the story describes a hypothetical example of how a hardware attack might play out, as the story makes clear.""Early Friday, one lawmaker’s office hinted to Codebook that Bloomberg's article might be accurate — but backtracked later in the day. Also on Friday, Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.) sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis asking about armed forces’ knowledge and exposure.Our thought bubble: It’s possible that well-meaning sources confused malware Apple reportedly found in Supermicro firmware with a hardware-based espionage campaign. The two are not equivalent — the firmware problem was quickly dealt with. Glass houses disclaimer: Reporters make mistakes. Codebook makes mistakes. Sources are sometimes wrong. And good journalism often necessitates anonymous sources. Editor's note: This story has been updated with new comment from Bloomberg."
791,7,2021/09,electronicsweekly_googlenews,Record Q1 for M&A,"After a surge in semiconductor M&A announcements in the second half of 2020, the strong M&A momentum carried into the beginning of 2021, with purchase agreements for chip companies, business units, product lines, and related assets reaching a total value of $15.8 billion in 1Q21, setting a record-high level for the first quarter of a year.However, the pace of semiconductor acquisition agreements fell back over the next five months of 2021, putting this year’s total M&A value at $22.0 billion for the January-August timeperiod, according to IC Insights’ September Update of the 2021 McClean Report.Figure 1The full-year 2020 M&A value jumped to an all-time annual record of $117.9 billion after business conditions stabilized in the second half of last year from the Covid-19 virus pandemic.Between September and December 2020, the combined value of semiconductor M&A deals amounted to $94.5 billion with the announcements of four megadeals in the four-month period: Nvidia’s planned $40 billion acquisition of processor-design technology supplier ARM; AMD’s pending $35 billion purchase of FPGA leader Xilinx; Marvell Technology’s completed $10 billion takeover of interconnect chip supplier Inphi; and Intel’s announced $9 billion sale of its NAND flash business and 300mm fab in China to SK Hynix. Three of these four 2020 megadeals are still waiting for regulatory clearance, including China’s approval in the midst of its trade war with the U.S.Like last year, the 2021 M&A total could get a significant boost in the next several months, if agreements are reached in potential megadeals that have been reported in the press and other major moves by companies looking to strengthen their positions in high-growth markets.In the summer, Intel was reportedly in talks to buy GlobalFoundries for about $30 billion to strengthen its renewed wafer foundry efforts, and a possible $20 billion-plus merger was being explored by NAND flash-memory partners Western Digital (owner of SanDisk) and Kioxia (formerly Toshiba’s Memory Division).However, GlobalFoundries and Kioxia are now believed to be moving ahead with planned initial public offerings (IPOs) of stock in 4Q21.There were fourteen semiconductor acquisition announcements made between January and August this year with the 2021 average value being $1.6 billion versus the same number of agreements in the first eight months 2020, which had an average value per deal of about $1.7 billion.As has been the case since in the middle of the last decade, semiconductor acquisitions in 2021 are primarily being driven by industry consolidation in a number of product and manufacturing segments as well as IC companies looking to increase their presence in strong end-use applications—particularly in industrial IoT, robotics, self-driving vehicles and driver-assist automation, AI and ML capabilities, image recognition, and new high-speed wireless connections to embedded systems, including the build-out of 5G cellular networks."
709,7,2021/09,Eetasia,Global Cellular IoT Module Shipments Reach 100 Million Mark for First Time in Q2 2021,"Global cellular IoT module quarterly shipments reached the 100 million mark for the first time in the second quarter of 2021, according to the latest research from Counterpoint Technology Market Research’s Global Cellular IoT Module, Chipset and Application Tracker. 5G was the fastest growing technology year-on-year (+800%), followed by 4G Cat 1 (+100%). However, NB-IoT captured close to a third of the market in terms of shipments. China alone contributed nearly 85% of the total NB-IoT module shipments in this quarter and continues to be the leading geography for cellular IoT use-cases and deployments.Commenting on the market dynamics, Research Analyst Soumen Mandal said, “Quectel, Fibocom and Telit are the top three players in global cellular IoT module revenue rankings, capturing nearly 40% of the total revenue during Q2 2021.”Quectel cellular IoT revenue grew 49% YoY during the quarter due to strong performance of NB-IoT and 4G Cat 1 modules in mainland China. Continuous rise in global presence, diversified product portfolio and increasing partnerships with more IoT module ecosystem players helped Quectel increase its market share in Q2 2021 compared to the previous quarter. Moreover, Quectel entered IoT antenna services, offering more than 250 antenna options. These services can be an alternative revenue source in the coming years. The vertical integration will help Quectel establish itself as a “true IoT” component solutions vendor in the global market."
710,7,2021/09,Eetasia,EV Makers Receive First-Half Jolt,"As traffic gradually returns to pre-pandemic volumes, you may have noticed among the brake lights more electric vehicles. More Teslas, an occasional Ford Mustang Mach-E, even a top-of-the-line Porsche Taycan (the supposed “Tesla killer”).Collectively, those sightings represent an estimated 160 percent increase in global EV sales during the first half of this year. Not bad considering lingering supply chain constraints, notes industry tracker Canalys. By comparison, the total global vehicle market rose only 26 percent during the same period, reflecting continuing component shortages, especially chips.The huge first-half jump in EV sales was fueled—or should we say charged—by robust Chinese demand. Canalys estimates 1.1 million EVs were sold in China between January and the end of June. That’s nearly as many as total EV sales for all of last year.“Only 6 percent of cars sold in 2020 in Mainland China were EVs – it will be more than double that for full-year 2021,” said Chris Jones, chief analyst and vice president of automotive and e-mobility at Canalys.Emerging Chinese EV makers, including Aion, BYD, Li Xiang, NIO and Xpeng, are seeking to transform the Chinese market as Tesla has done in the U.S. The Chinese entrants have identified an emerging niche, Canalys reckons: Four of the top 10 EVs sold during the first half of 2021 were “small city cars.”Despite all the Tesla’s on American roads and surging demand for EVs in Chinese cities, Europe still leads in EV adoption: battery EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs accounted for 15 percent of new car sales in Europe. More than 80 percent of new car sales in Norway were EVs.China is not far behind at 12 percent of new purchases. Surprisingly, EVs made up just 3 percent of U.S. car sales during the first six months of this year.  “One of the reasons for the slow uptake of EVs in the U.S. is limited vehicle choice, noted Sandy Fitzpatrick of Canalys.
“But carmakers are set to launch the first EVs in the hugely popular pick-up truck segment in the U.S. soon. If they’re successful, the perception of EVs should quickly change.”For now, Tesla remains the world’s EV leader with about 15 percent of the global market, aided by production facilities in the hottest market: China. VW Group (13 percent) benefits from strong European demand for EVs. The current chip shortage has created a backlog of orders for VW and other EV makers.Sustaining current EV sales won’t be easy as long as chip shortages persist. At least one European automaker is taking steps to shore up its component supply chains with capacity agreements.“The challenge for the carmakers is keeping up with EV demand during the component shortage crisis,” Fitzpatrick said.This article was originally published on EE Times.George Leopold has written about science and technology from Washington, D.C., since 1986.

760,7,2021/09,electronicsweekly_googlenews,"Chips are changing the car market, says Yole","The semiconductor value in a car will reach $78.5 billion in 2026, with a 14.75% CAGR 2020-2026.  A car has today, on average, $450 worth of semiconductors. In 2026, it will be $700.Future V2X communication platforms for 5G implementation are being designed today, and products are expected for 2024 with initial products are starting to appear with dual-4G and forward-compatible 5G capabilities.ADAS: Radars and cameras are the main sensors used by OEMs as they perform quite well and are relatively cheap. For a few years, LiDAR sensors have been slowly entering the automotive industry to provide more automated driving functions.New habits related to cars are emerging and Gen Y now desire connectivity, convenience and the possibility to choose from different range of transportation from A to B. They are shaping an industry in which in-demand car service providers are growing.OEMs have announced their electrification investment plans for the next 5 years which exceed $250 billion worldwide. The timeline for automotive electrification is very aggressive, as in 15 years OEMs will have to develop an entire car portfolio that will be fully electric.Supply chain management will change due to them chips shortage, an increasing semiconductor content and electrification. OEM s have to negotiate directly with chip manufacturers, learn from the consumer industry and keep “buffer stock”.Traditional OEMs (Audi, Hyundai, etc…) are facing disruptive OEMs (Tesla, Apple…). China is intensifying the competition and invests massively in semiconductors and in the automotive industry.Looking at the C.A.S.E. components:Connectivity will grow : from almost $33 billion in 2020 to almost $55 billion in 2026, with 14.55% CAGR2020-2026ADAS will reach more than $60 billion in 2026 with 6.50% CAGR2020-2026Sharing will reach about $3 billion in 2026 with 10.39% CAGR2020-2026Electrification will reach $28,804 million in 2026, with 53.45% CAGR2020-2026All adding up to a 2035 market for C.A.S.E. worth $318 billion.Semiconductor wafer shipments will grow from 20 million to more than 45 million, with 8’’ being the most used wafer size.The 20nm node and below will be driven by ADAS and infotainment applications.“Today, most of the wafer production for automotive is for 130/180 nm and more, and leading-edge technology is very scarce,” says Yole’s Eric Mounier, “but 40nm and 28nm are used for the Mobileye EyeQ3 and EyeQ4 for ADAS and autonomy. Memory for infotainment and ADAS use 10-14 nm. In the future, 7nm could be used for ADAS. The current chip shortage mainly affects nodes in the 40-180nm range”.The development of electric vehicles and self-driving technologies naturally attracts OEMs and Tier-1 component suppliers. Therefore, new OEMs like Nio, Xpeng, and Lucid Motors, among others, have recently entered the industry.Other players coming from the semiconductor or the consumer industries will enter the field as well.In this race to full autonomy, large OEMs with many resources – like Volkswagen – will develop the necessary software by themselves or partner with or acquire robotic vehicle companies.Generalist OEMs with few resources are expected to rely on Tier-1s to develop basic automated driving features.These Tier-1s will have to master camera, radar, LiDAR sensors, and the computing. According to Pierrick Boulay, Technology & Market Analyst, Solid-state Lighting at Yole: “Companies from the semiconductor side, like Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Intel-Mobileye, are positioning themselves, sometimes through acquisitions, at the center of automated driving systems.For example, Qualcomm is in talk to acquire Veoneer to reinforce its position in the automotive industry”. Companies coming from the consumer industry, like Apple, Huawei, or Xiaomi, are also entering the market.Depending on their strategy, they could develop only the self-driving part or the entire electric car, like Huawei is doing.Foxconn is partnering with several companies such as Apple and Stellantis and is increasing its automotive-related business.This new role of subcontractor, like Foxconn, is growing, and a recent partnership between Fisker and Magna showed that Magna will assemble the car. In the future, it could be possible to see new automotive OEMs being fabless and relying on the experience of subcontractors.The COVID-19 crisis has emphasized the increasing importance of semiconductors in cars. Companies coming from the semiconductor and software sides have strong financial power and could acquire some Tier-1s or Tier-2s’ companies. This could reshape the automotive landscape in the coming years"

Not that they have been unfair.The Chinese technology market has been rocked by a wave of regulatory actions in recent quarters that changed the business landscape amid crackdowns by the country’s government on other areas of national activity. Tech titans were hit with fines and business model shakeups — business model terminations, in the case of many edtech companies — while certain cultural items like celebrity fan culture and media were also taken to task.The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.You might imagine that a broad push by a central government to more control both its national economy and mind wouldn’t be conducive to overall startup fundraising and activity. And yet.When The Exchange recently looked into the Chinese venture capital market in the wake of some of its national government’s regulatory actions, things appeared surprisingly stable. Since then, data from CB Insights covering the full Q3 period has made an even stronger case: Putting aside a single outsized 2018 round, the third quarter of 2021 was the best three-month period for Chinese startups ever.And not just in the value of the rounds they raised — they also raised more rounds.We were surprised. But that’s what makes data useful: No matter what you expect, what actually happened will set your thinking straight.This morning, we’re digging into the data, looking at leading rounds to better understand where the money is going, and — with some help from TechBuzzChina’s Chinese technology analyst and angel investor, Rui Ma — trying to get our heads around what’s going on.Let’s talk China!China’s monster Q3Sure, the value of Alibaba stock fell from a 52-week high of $319.32 per share to just $166.82. Didi dropped from a recent local maxim of $18.01 to $8.24. And the value of Tencent Music collapsed from $32.25 — its last 52-week high — to just $7.72 per share (all data via Yahoo Finance).But leading tech companies’ plummeting stock prices have done seemingly nothing to blunt interest in Chinese technology startups.

Aria Alamalhodaei took a deep dive into Urban Movement Labs, a nonprofit organization that spun out of LA Mayor Eric Garcetti’s office, and what it’s doing to prepare the city for eVTOLS. If we have learned anything from ride-hailing and scooters, cities can’t start thinking about future forms of transportation too soon.As always, you can email me at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions or tips. You also can send a direct message to me at Twitter — @kirstenkorosec.Micromobbin’This week, I sat down with Mike Radenbaugh, CEO of Rad Power Bikes, as part of an ongoing TechCrunch+ series picking the brains of transportation founders. Radenbaugh started his company when he was only 15, throwing together parts he ordered from Radio Shack and eBay to create the earliest versions of what are now wildly popular e-bikes.We talked about how to navigate logistics in these tricky times, how to make a bike that people actually want to ride and what it takes to power the e-bike revolution. The interview is behind a paywall, so here’s a quick excerpt (but you should definitely subscribe to get the full content):The mission-driven nature of business is that this stuff is in my blood. It flows through everyone in this organization; we are all here on that same mission. There are a lot of new entrants into the space that are trying to replicate what Rad does at a much smaller scale, or are in it for more mercenary reasons, and it’s a very different business. It’s just the way we think about building something that really can solve the climate disaster.Meanwhile, Bird had a busy week. The micromobility startup officially launched its sidewalk riding detection technology in Milwaukee and San Diego and has plans to expand it to Madrid by early next year, followed by more cities. The tech, which is co-developed by wireless semiconductors and high-precision positioning module producer u-blox, will be on all new vehicles coming off the assembly line.This development makes Bird the latest of shared operators to announce the addition of what I like to call scooter advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that can detect poor rider behavior and correct it in real time by bringing the rider to a stop. Superpedestrian recently acquired Navmatic to integrate a similar technology, which relies on hyper-accurate positioning and sensor fusion to determine sidewalk riding, whereas other companies like Spin, Voi and Helbiz are attaching cameras to their scooters for a more computer vision-based approach.In other Bird news, the company also nabbed $150 million, up from $40 million, in a financing credit facility from Apollo Investment Corporation (Disclaimer: Apollo acquired Verizon Media Group, which owned TechCrunch. The company is now called Yahoo Inc.). This upsize will go into effect once Bird’s SPAC merger with Switchback II Corporation officially closes. The shareholder meeting to approve and confirm the deal is happening on November 2. The extra funds will help Bird purchase more vehicles this winter so it can further expand its footprint, giving it time to earn revenue in spring and summer, which it will use to pay Apollo back, according to the company.Rad Power Bikes founder Mike Radenbaugh on fueling the e-bike revolutionSpeaking of expanding footprints, Russian tech giant Yandex is developing more of a presence in Israel with the recent acquisition of shared e-scooter company Wind’s Israeli operations, which includes 10,000 Wind scooters. Yandex only recently launched an e-scooter sharing service in its home market, but only has about 5,000 scooters on the ground, so this will significantly increase the company’s fleet size. The Russian company is already operating or testing out other mobility platforms in Israel; it has a ride-hailing and last-mile delivery service (Yango) and an express grocery delivery service (Yango Deli) on the ground, and is testing out autonomous delivery robots and self-driving cars.Dott is joining the multi-modal game with its launch of an e-bike-sharing service in Paris. The bikes will join Dott’s fleet of e-scooters in the City of Love, along with Lime and Tier.Gogoro, the Taiwanese e-scooter maker, officially launched its popular battery swapping service in China with 45 stations in Hangzhou. The company is targeting 80 stations by the end of the year before expanding into other major cities with its partners Yadea and Dachangjiang Group (DCJ).Swft, a budding mobility startup that started late last year selling electric hoverboards and has since launched three e-bikes and an e-moped, has raised $10 million in seed funding. The company plans to use the money to expand its light-duty vehicle offerings, adding to its lineup a couple of electric motorcycles, a four-wheeler, a three-wheeler and a scooter over the next couple of years. Swft operates on a D2C model but says its bikes are also being sold through Best Buy.VanMoof has teased its new high-speed bike, the VanMoof V, via live YouTube video. The plan is to release the bike, which should cost about $3,598, by the end of 2022. The company says the bike will be able reach a top speed of 37 miles per hour. That doesn’t mean riders will be able to accelerate up to 37 mph, as speed restrictions in Europe, and elsewhere, fall well below that. Maybe VanMoof will force transport authorities to take another look at the current regulations for what does and does not maketh a bike.Populus could probably help with that. The company’s platform pulls data from fleets of shared vehicles and delivers that info to cities to help planners understand and manage how streets are used. Populus is now beginning Phase II of a U.S. Department of Transportation-funded initiative to work with micromobility operators and leverage data from over 80 million trips to help public agencies create safer streets. Over 15 cities are participating, including Cleveland, Washington, D.C. area cities, Bay Area cities, Lexington and Charlottesville, among others. Maybe they’ll come to the conclusion that we’ve known all along — find ways to take more space from cars and create more protected bike lanes……so that sweet scooters like the new Blizwheel can ride safely! The Blizwheel is a portable, foldable wee thing, weighing less than nine pounds and only 15.6 inches in length. Despite its size, it is mighty, with a top speed of 12 miles per hour. The eight-mile range leaves something to be desired, but presumably, if it makes it to market, that’s something the company can work on. Blizwheel has so far been funded over 1,033% via kickstarter, with around $109,000 in funding.Finally, let’s wrap with this fun and fresh news. MoonBikes, the maker of electric snowbikes (!!!) has announced the close of a $5 million seed round. The MoonBike created by engineer Nicolas Muron, who was born and raised in the French Alps, actually looks like an e-bike and a snowmobile had a baby, with a light frame, one ski in the front and a track in the back. The target rider for this contraption is a resident of an icy tundra who wants a cool way to commute, or a mountain person who wants something three times lighter than a snowmobile. It can climb groomed slopes with a 40% steepness grade, has a top speed of 26 miles per hour and a range of up to three hours with the optional dual battery. — Rebecca BellanDeal of the weekVroom, the online used car marketplace that filed to go public in 2020 and is now listed on the Nasdaq exchange under the VRM ticker, is using its access to capital to swoop up other companies as it seeks new ways to generate revenue.This time, Vroom has agreed to acquire auto financing company United Auto Credit Corporation for $300 million in cash.

Welcome back to Policy Corner.President Joe Biden is reportedly facing pressure to pass the bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and the Democrat-crafted $3.5 trillion budget bill before the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland at the end of the month, The Hill reported. The budget bill in particular contains a number of spending provisions aimed at driving down the country’s carbon emissions, like a clean energy tax credit and a methane emissions fee for the oil and gas industry.But there are still a few major sticking points. Beyond the sheer size of the budget bill — which has both conservative Democrats and Republicans leery — there are a few provisions that are still facing major opposition. Last month I wrote about how automakers like Honda, Toyota and Tesla are opposing a section that would expand tax incentives by as much as $4,500 for electric vehicles that were manufactured in union shops in the United States.It seems that the fight is far from over. Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia — a state home to a single auto assembly plant by Kia — sent a letter to Georgia’s congressional delegation urging them to oppose the additional incentive. He said in a statement that limiting the tax incentive “puts Georgia workers at a severe disadvantage.” South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster sent his own letter urging the removal of the provision. South Carolina is home to three assembly plants, respectively owned by BMW, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz.Lobbying by automakers has already increased so far this year compared to the same period last year, according to spending transparency platform OpenSecrets. Toyota spent $3.3 million in the first half of this year, compared to $2.9 million for the same period of 2020; both Ford and General Motors have also spent more on lobbying this year compared to last.I was also interested in this small piece of news out of Colorado, where the state’s largest investor-owned utility, Xcel Energy, is commencing a new pilot plant with six automakers to study how to best match EV charging times with times of day when renewable energy is plentiful.The Charging Perks pilot is open to 600 drivers of BMW, Chevy, Ford, Honda or Tesla EVs. Without getting too far in the weeds, the pilot will use day-ahead forecasts of renewable energy availability and pair that with drivers’ charging needs to create a customized charging schedule.This caught my eye because it’s well and good to say you want a million EVs on the road by 2030 — which is Colorado’s stated goal — but without proper planning it’s hard to see how we’ll get there without overwhelming the electric grid. Electric utilities are going to be key players in ensuring any kind of transition to electric mobility, so I’ll be eager to see the results of this pilot (or if it scales in the future).— Aria AlamalhodaeiCatching up with KodiakKodiak Robotics introduced its fourth-generation autonomous truck in late September. Image Credits: Kodiak RoboticsA few weeks ago, Kodiak Robotics revealed details about its fourth-generation autonomous truck system and announced it was expanding its own fleet by 15 PACCAR Class 8 trucks. (They have 10 trucks in the field today.)The tl;dr: the fourth-gen truck has a modular sensor suite that includes a center pod on the front roofline of the truck as well as pods integrated into both of the side mirrors. I caught up with co-founder and CEO Don Burnette, at the time, to learn more about what one of the last smaller AV developers is doing as is goes up against better funded and larger companies also trying to commercialize self-driving trucks.The first thing on my mind was why should I care about this new generation truck? And what does it mean for Kodiak? My assumption, and likely yours as well, is that this new truck is an improvement over the previous version. But I wanted to know exactly what improved. Burnette said one of the primary goals was stability.“Part of the challenge in self driving is that you have hardware, sensors, computers, network switches, cables and power systems — and decisions that need to be made, all the time, 10 times a second or even 100 times a second. And computers are finicky, these components and bits are finicky. The more we can improve our systems to deal with errors and handle errors is great, but actually building more reliable hardware — in the first place — and building more reliable architectures — in the first place — really helps improve the stability of the overall system.”Burnette said that, in turn, accelerates development of software and ultimately allows the company to show better performance on the commercial side. The upshot: this new generation is more “stable” and “rugged.”The other significant “improvement” or change at this stage is that Kodiak is able to start to showcasing where they’re going in the future. Previous generations were a bit more “prototype-y” (Burnette’s word, not mine). This generation is more integrated, has more redundancy, is more sophisticated and is pushing into the industrial design phase of Kodiak’s development program. Importantly, he said “we really wanted to put a stake in the ground and make a statement about how we envision the use case of this technology in the long run.”Burnette said that trucking fleets care a lot about downtime. And as he began to think through what deploying an AV fleet at scale might look like, he imagined there would be a need for specialized technicians throughout the country, ready to diagnose an issue and repair a sensor. “I think that’s a high bar — that’s a lot of burden to place on the maintenance infrastructure network of various fleets, and so we wanted to create a design that was particularly modular so that in the field, if there’s an issue, you can just pull off the modular system and put on a new one.”Obviously, that means these systems have to be robust, easy to install and sensors have to be calibrated correctly and in advance. Without getting too deep in the weeds, Burnette said that’s exactly what they’re doing. And he mentioned they’ve already tested swapping out one modular system after one of the mirrors on a truck was damaged (while parked btw). The change worked and the truck was back testing the following day. “We think we can get that time down considerably and at scale for real commercial deployment.”Notable news and other tidbitsADAS (meaning drivers still must take over)AAA found in a new study that advanced driver-assistance technology is significantly reduced by moderate and heavy rain, especially auto emergency braking and lane-keeping systems.During closed course testing, AAA simulated rainfall and found that test vehicles equipped with automatic emergency braking traveling at 35 mph collided with a stopped vehicle 33% of the time. Lane keeping assistance didn’t fare any better, with test vehicles departing their lane 69% of the time, according to the study. AAA pointed to the results as another reason that testing standards should incorporate real-world conditions that drivers normally encounter.The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent a pair of letters to Tesla targeting the company’s use of non-disclosure agreements for owners who gain early access to its “full self-driving” software beta as well as its decision to use an over-the-air software update to fix an issue that regulators say should have been a recall.The letters signal NHTSA’s increasing scrutiny of Tesla and its practices related to over-the-air software updates and automated driving features within its Autopilot advanced driver assistance system.Autonomous vehicles (no driver? no problem)Waymo vehicles in San Francisco got a bit of extra attention from a local TV network, which then spread like wildfire on social media, when the AVs kept going down the same dead end street, where they would be forced to make three-point turns. I asked Waymo about this. Here’s their statement:“We continually adjust to dynamic San Francisco road rules. In this case, cars traveling North of California on 15th Ave have to take a u-turn due to the presence of Slow Streets signageon Lake. So, the Waymo Driver was obeying the same road rules that any car is required to follow. “That didn’t really answer my question as to why the cars kept going down the street, especially since the “slow streets” designation had been in place for some time. Apparently, this was a street that Waymo wanted to drive on and learn from and  that the vehicles are now being limited in that area.Electric vehiclesElectric Last Mile Solutions, a commercial electric vehicle company, said it will open a new tech hub in San Francisco. The “urban mobility lab” will focus on advanced in-vehicle technology, edge-to-cloud architecture, data-intensive applications and machine learning.General Motors started shipping to dealers replacement battery modules for recalled Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles after delays caused by shutdowns at multiple manufacturing plants as a result of the widespread shortage of semiconductors. Meanwhile, LG Electronics agreed to reimburse GM up to $1.9 billion to pay for the recall and repairs to thousands of Bolts. The issue isn’t totally resolved yet; GM says it will idle the Orion Assembly plant where Bolts are produced until November 1 so it can focus on repairing the EVs that already exist before it makes any new ones.National Grid in New England used a Thomas Built Buses Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley electric school bus equipped with a Proterra battery system to send electricity back into the regional grid over 30 events this summer, an example of vehicle-to-grid technology.Porsche’s electric Taycan outsold its iconic internal combustion-powered 911 sports car in the first nine months of the year, a milestone for the EV that was introduced in late 2019. Sales overall were up 13% compared to the same nine-month period last year, an increase driven by a nearly threefold increase in Taycan deliveries as well as growth by its popular gas-powered Macan vehicle. Porsche delivered 28,640 Taycan vehicles in the January-to-September period and 27,972 of its 911 sports cars, which also grew compared to last year.In-car techHyundai Motor is the latest automaker to announce plans to develop its own semiconductor chips in order to reduce reliance on chipmakers.Spotify’s in-car entertainment system “Car Thing,” which launched this spring on an invite-only basis, is now becoming more broadly available, TechCrunch’s Sarah Perez reported. Car Thing will become available to U.S. users who want to purchase the $79.99 device.Volvo is working with a company called BreezoMeter, which uses a network of about 47,000 sensors and satellites to detect and report on air quality. The company delivers micro-local environmental intelligence (within five meters of the driver) through the vehicle’s HMI (human-machine interface). The information is available on all new 90 and 60 Series Volvo models.Misc. stuffAB Volvo, the construction truck arm of Sweden’s Volvo Group, unveiled a new vehicle made with a majority of “fossil-free” steel. The company plans to begin smaller-scale series production using the new material as early as 2022. The prototype vehicle, a fully electric and autonomous load carrier for use in mining and quarries, is composed of over 3,000 kilograms (6,600 pounds) of the new steel. Volvo said it targeted construction trucks first because, on average, around 70% of the vehicle weight comes from steel and cast iron.Financial Times digs into the flaws of Biden’s “open all hours” ports strategy.Luminar has hired two new executives, Debra Poppas as its quality leader, who previously was a VP of quality at PACCAR, and Sameer Ladiwala as chief accounting officer. Ladiwala held a similar position at the semiconductor and software design company Arm.Swvl, Treepz, Jatri, SafeBoda, Urbvan, Chalo and Buser are some of the startups that have popped up in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America in recent years, all with a focus on providing on-demand access to transportation. Not only are these startups products of the emerging markets, but because mobility is so essential to a thriving economy, they’re actually driving development. Rebecca Bellan gives us an introduction into these startups and how they are driving growth in this sector.

A story from the latter category ended up in our wheelhouse when a state governor decided that a journalist pointing out security flaws in an official website was malicious hacking. Perhaps stories like this are why so many Gen Z folks are doomers?Instacart shoppers are going on strike: Try to recall a time when some section of the Instacart workforce was happy and not either about to strike or on strike. It’s hard, yeah? This Saturday, “some Instacart shoppers will go on strike, protesting the company’s low pay and lack of communication with its laborers,” TechCrunch reports. Let’s see if this particular piece of the larger Striketober saga ends up with worker-friendly results.Apple yanks Quran app after Chinese regulators ask: The day after Microsoft announced that it was going to pull LinkedIn’s main service from China after failing to reconcile that country’s government and its own views, Apple appears to have complied with a Chinese state request to remove “Quran Majeed, a popular app for reading the Islamic religious text and other prayer-related information” from the Chinese app store. This isn’t a small act, given the Chinese state’s abuse of Muslims inside its borders.Startups/VCLet’s take our time today in the world of startups, it being Friday and all.First up, we have a great piece from Rebecca Bellan digging into a host of startups that are helping emerging middle classes around the world get places.

918,9,2021/04,Eetasia,US Puts Chinaí»s Phytium on Entity List for Making Missiles Using Western Tech,"Tianjin Phytium Information Technology Co. is one of seven companies that the US put on its Entity List after the Washington Post reported that China used American and Taiwanese chip technology to create the world’s first hypersonic missiles.Phytium used American EDA tools to design chips that were manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) for use in a supercomputer which simulated the performance of DF-17 hypersonic missiles that China rolled out at its 2019 October 1 National Day parade, according to the Washington Post report.The DF-17 appears designed to evade ballistic missile defense systems deployed by the US and its allies in the Pacific, according to a report in The National Interest.  A hypersonic missile strike could help to eliminate ballistic missile defense systems, increasing the lethality of a subsequent missile strike, allowing near complete destruction of infrastructure such as runways and hangars, tipping the scales of a conflict, according to the Institute for National Defense and Security Research (INDSR), a Taiwan government-funded think tank."
984,9,2021/04,Nikkei,Biden's chip 'arms race' with China will add to global uncertainty,"Nina Xiang is the founder of China Money Network, a media platform tracking China's venture and tech sectors. She is author of ""Red AI: Victories and Warnings from China's Rise in Artificial Intelligence."""
990,9,2021/04,axios,Technology Why threats to Taiwan are a nightmare for tech,"Threats to Taiwan, the self-governing island only slightly bigger than Maryland, are sending shivers through the global tech industry.Why it matters: Taiwan is home to 92% of the world's leading-edge chip manufacturing operations and a vital center for producing other tech components, including laptops and PC motherboards. Driving the news:Just this week, the U.S. military warned that China could be accelerating its longstanding efforts to regain control of Taiwan.A global semiconductor shortage has highlighted the world's dependence on chips, as well as the increasingly vital role that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) plays in the industry.That's because most companies that design chips today — Qualcomm, Nvidia and Apple among them — don''t actually do the manufacturing, instead relying on companies like TSMC.What they're saying: “This is the most important 14,000-square-mile island in the world,” says Stephen Ezell, VP of global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.Catch up quick: Ever since China's Nationalists were defeated by the Communists in 1949 and fled to Taiwan, Beijing has viewed the island as part of China's sovereign territory. But it operates independently, with its own elections, military, and currency. Around a dozen countries have formal diplomatic relations with Taipei and many others, including the U.S., maintain informal relations.The U.S. consumed more than $63 billion worth of Taiwanese tech exports throughout the first eight months of last year, or 32 percent of the island's output. China accounted for 30% and Europe about 22%, per Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute.If Taiwan's chip production were permanently disrupted, the Semiconductor Industry Association estimates it would take three years and $350 billion in investment to build enough capacity to replace it.The big picture: Foreign policy experts and tech trade groups have been sounding alarms about the consequences if Taiwan were to come under tighter Chinese control.“The threat is manifest during this decade — in fact, in the next six years,” Admiral Philip Davidson, the top military leader in the Asia-Pacific region, told a Senate hearing last month, per AP.Between the lines: The recent crackdown in Hong Kong following passage of a strict ""national security law"" is seen as a wake-up call with regards to Taiwan.""Until Beijing changes its current policy, it’s critical to point out that the PRC’s formula for unification with Taiwan is still based on 'One Country, Two Systems' — the model that it applies to Hong Kong,"" says Russell Hsiao, executive director of the Global Taiwan Institute. ""And it’s clear as day for people to see how that’s going for the people of Hong Kong.""That's why many in the industry are calling for the U.S. to be clearer about its support for Taiwan and, at the same time, to encourage investment in domestic chip production.""I think that Taiwan needs to be the center point of the Biden Administration national security economic strategy in the Pacific and Asia,"" Ezell said.""China is in the process of testing this administration. It is going to continue to exert pressure on Taiwan on the U.S.-Taiwan relationship."""
989,9,2021/04,Nikkei,TSMC's Morris Chang calls on Taiwan to defend its chip industry,"TAIPEI -- Morris Chang, the founder and former chairman of the world's most valuable chip company, has called on Taiwan and its government to defend the island's semiconductor manufacturing leadership amid a push by the U.S. and China to build up their own chipmaking capabilities."
960,9,2021/04,electronicsweekly_googlenews,Taiwan blocks China recruitment,"Taiwan’s Labour Ministry has told agencies not to list China-located jobs especially those in the chip industry.“Due to geopolitical tension between the U.S. and China, China’s semiconductor development has suffered some setbacks and as a result China has become more aggressive in poaching and targeting top Taiwanese chip talent to help build a self-sufficient supply chain,” says a Labour Ministry notice seen by the Nikkei.Offenders will be fined. “If the recruitment involves semiconductors and integrated circuits, the penalty will be even higher,” says the Labour Ministry’s notice.The ban also applies to Taiwanese companies with plants in mainland China who want to recruit staff in work in China."
925,9,2021/04,electronicsweekly_googlenews,Taiwan vs China,"The 25 Chinese warplanes constituted the largest incursion since the island first started reporting such activity in September 2020.The aircraft involved in the incursion were 14 J-16 fighter jets, 4 J-10 fighter jets, 4 H-6K bombers, 2 Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft and a single KJ-500 warning and control aircraft.Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense stated that it used its own fighter jets and missile systems to monitor the Chinese activity with radio warnings issued.What makes Monday’s incident notable is the sheer number of Peoples Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) aircraft involved.The scale and frequency of Chinese aerial activity has grown since the beginning of 2021 and most of it has been concentrated in the northern end of the South China Sea.US-China tensions escalated with the Trump administration’s decision to supply Taipei with advanced variants of the F-16 fighter jet, along with other items of modern military hardware.In recent years, China has modernized its military, introducing the J-20, an indigenous 5th generation stealth fighter. It has also commissioned two aircraft carriers along with several modern amphibious transport dock/landing vessels.Even though the possibility of China taking Taiwan by force is low, the military balance in the Taiwan Strait is firmly in China’s favour.The following infographic provides an overview of that imbalance and is based on an annual U.S. government report. January was a particularly busy month with a steady uptick in Chinese sorties as the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group sailed through the region. It was reported that PLAAF aircraft conducted mock attack runs on the American ships.Between late February and most of March, Chinese aerial activity in Taiwan’s ADIZ remained consistent, though relatively small scale, usually involving no more than one or two aircraft.That changed towards the end of March with 20 Chinese aircraft flying into Taiwan’s ADIZ on March 26. In April, 10 or more warplanes also flew into it on at least three occasions ahead of Monday’s incident.Last week also saw the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning and its escorts operating east of Taiwan at the same time PLAAF aircraft were airborne to the west of the island.All of this activity has heightened fears of a military clash. Taiwan’s Pratas Island is viewed as being especially vulnerable due to its isolation and 500 Taiwanese marines have reportedly been deployed there.  "

1046,10,2017/01,electronicsweekly_googlenews,Tsinghua announces huge memory fab in Nanjing,"Tsinghua says the project is part of China’s efforts to build a world-leading chip industry, and it hopes it will create a siphoning effect to attract more development.China is trying to reduce its annual $235 billion bill for ICs. The government has put up a $160 billion fund to help achieve that.Tsinghua also has a controlling interest in Yangtze River Storage Technology which broke ground last week on its $24 billion 3D NAND fab in Wuhan where first silicon is expected in 2018 and full capacity of 300k wpm expected in 2020.A third Tsinghua-controlled fab is expected to be announced in Chengu with ground broken during this year. Chengu is expected to be a $24 billion logic fab.China’s fab building spree is thought to be in response to the US strategy of refusing to let China buy up US chip companies.Late last year US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker warned about the scale of  China’s chip investment. “This unprecedented state-driven interference would distort the market and undermine the innovation ecosystem,” said Pritzker, “the world has seen the effects of this type of targeted, government-led interference before, the result has been overcapacity in the global marketplace that has artificially reduced prices, cost jobs in both the United States and around the world, and caused significant damage to those industries globally.”The incoming Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, told his confirmation hearing earlier this week that he is “very very concerned” about China’s semiconductor policy."
1062,10,2017/01,TechCruch,"Qualcomm faces FTC charges over monopolistic í«no license, no chipsí» claim","Qualcomm faces FTC charges over monopolistic ‘no license, no chips’ claimBrian Heater@bheater / 6:40 AM GMT+8•January 18, 2017comment CommentcameraImage Credits: Justin Sullivan (opens in a new window)After facing similar charges around the world, Qualcomm is getting some major pushback on its home turf. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has filed charges against the company, accusing the San Diego-based Snapdragon-maker of anticompetitive tactics in an attempt to maintain a monopoly in its chip business.The commission issued a statement today detailing the allegations in what it’s deemed a “no license, no chips” policy that charges the company of elevating licensing fees for patents, and in turn, forcing phone makers to pay more for using a competitor’s chip.According to the FTC:“No license, no chips” is a condition that other suppliers of semiconductor devices do not impose. The risk of losing access to Qualcomm baseband processors is too great for a cell phone manufacturer to bear because it would preclude the manufacturer from selling phones for use on important cellular networks.The complaint officially cites Apple in its list of anticompetitive practices, effectively accusing Qualcomm of shutting other chip makers out of competing for the iPhone maker’s business, due to the high-profile media windfall of striking a deal with the company.The filing seeks to, “order Qualcomm to cease its anticompetitive conduct and take actions to restore competitive conditions.”The FTC complaint is the latest in a long string of anticompetitive complaints levied around the world against Qualcomm, which have resulted in large fines in South Korea ($854 million) and China ($975 million), along with scrutiny in the EU.

999,10,2017/01,RCR,"Qualcomm reports stronger sales, weaker modem shipments","Qualcomm said its sales were up during its first fiscal quarter, but modem shipments were down. The leading developer of chipsets for mobile devices reported $6 billion in revenue for the most recent quarter, and $800 million in operating profit. Revenue was up 4% versus the year-ago quarter, but operating profit was down 54%. The company’s shares fell on the news.The drop in operating profit was due to a fine levied against Qualcomm by the government of South Korea. Regulators in that country have fined the company approximately $854 million for allegedly forcing customers to pay extra for its patent licenses in order to maintain access to the company’s chipsets. Qualcomm denies those charges and is contesting the fine.The chipmaker’s non-generally accepted accounting practices operating profit, which did not include the fine, was $2.1 billion, up 19% from the year-ago quarter. Net income increased 21% to $1.8 billion.Mobile station modem chipset shipments were down 10% versus a year ago, Qualcomm said. The company cited softness in the Chinese market and said one unnamed customer in particular had been impacted by credit problems. In China, Qualcomm also faces stiff competition from Asian chip suppliers like MediaTek, Samsung and Spreadtrum.During its earnings call the company also discussed the $1 billion dollar lawsuit brought by Apple late last week. Like the South Korean government, Apple is unhappy with the fees it has to pay to license Qualcomm’s patents. The iPhone maker cooperated with South Korean authorities in their efforts to fine Qualcomm, and now Apple claims the chipmaker is retaliating by withholding funds owed to Apple.“The recent legal and governmental actions against Qualcomm are at their core driven by commercial disputes,” Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said in the company’s earnings announcement. “As we have done in the past, we will vigorously defend our business model and the value of a portfolio of technologies that has been so instrumental to the success of the mobile communications industry.”Mollenkopf also highlighted the company’s acquisition of NXP Semiconductor, which has not yet closed. NXP became the world’s largest maker of automotive chipsets through its recent purchase of Freescale, and now Qualcomm will be able to combine that business with its own automotive chipset unit.“The pending NXP acquisition accelerates our strategic transformation in the high growth areas of automotive, [internet of things], security and networking,” Mollenkopf said. “We are very well positioned to lead as the semiconductor engine for the intelligent, connected world.”Follow me on Twitter."
1106,10,2017/01,TechCruch,Meizu is the latest Chinese smartphone firm to sign a licensing deal with Qualcomm,"Meizu is the latest Chinese smartphone firm to sign a licensing deal with QualcommJon Russell@jonrussell / 6:53 PM GMT+8•January 3, 2017comment CommentQualcomm was hit by a near $1 billion fine for violating China’s antitrust regulations in 2015. That was rock bottom — and another example of a U.S. tech firm coming unstuck in China — but the chip-maker spent 2016 steadily sewing up licensing significant agreements, the latest being a deal with Meizu announced on December 31.Meizu is one of China’s prominent phone makers — its affordable devices compete with those from Xiaomi and others. It claimed over 20 million sales in 2015 and, though it ran into some issues and made layoffs last year, it counts Alibaba among its investors.Back in June, Qualcomm filed a patent infringement suit against Meizu alleging that it had spent more than a year negotiating with the company regarding its use of certain 3G and 4G standards. Now, however, Qualcomm has granted Meizu a license over the patents in question after the duo reached an agreement. Qualcomm has, in turn, dropped its legal cases against Meizu in China, Germany, France, and the U.S..The Meizu alliance follows deals with Vivo and Oppo, the word’s fourth and fifth-largest smartphone sellers and the top two in China, as well as deals with Hisense, Yulong and Lenovo. All told, Qualcomm said it has licenses with more than 100 partners in China.Unsurprisingly, given the size of China’s mobile market, these deals are hugely important to Qualcomm. The firm said new licensing deals from China were a key driver of its impressive Q4 financial results, which saw net income rise 51 percent year-on-year to reach $1.6 billion.

1153,11,2021/10,axios,Economy & Business China's economic growth slows,"China's economy grew 4.9% in the third quarter of 2021 compared with a year earlier, the country's National Bureau of Statistics announced Monday.Why it matters: The gross domestic product growth in the July-September period in the world’s second-largest economy marked the ""weakest pace since the third quarter of 2020 and slowing from 7.9% in the second quarter,"" Reuters notes.""September industrial output rose 3.1% from a year earlier, missing expectations, down from August's 5.3%, and marking the slowest growth since March 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic,"" Reuters added.Driving the news: Contributing factors include computer chip shortages, power cuts at steel mills and a construction slowdown during the pandemic, as signs of stress pile up in China’s real estate development sector, per the New York Times.""Growth is under pressure from government controls aimed at making the energy-hungry economy more efficient and at reducing reliance on debt that Chinese leaders worry is dangerously high and could cause financial problems,"" according to AP.What they're saying: National Bureau of Statistics spokesperson Fu Linghui warned ""the current international environment uncertainties are mounting, and the domestic economic recovery is still unstable and uneven,"" per an NYT translation.Flashback: China ended 2020 as the only major country to see its economy grow rather than shrink during the pandemic.Chinese government officials in March set the country's annual economic growth target at over 6%."
1173,11,2021/10,Eletimes,Chip Shortage and Power Crunch hit China Auto Industry,"China’s auto sales slumped 19.6% in September from a year earlier, industry data showed on Tuesday, falling for a fifth consecutive month as a prolonged global shortage of semiconductors and a domestic power crunch disrupt production.This time of year, known as “Golden September, Silver October”, is usually a high point in sales for the auto industry, with consumers making purchases after staying away from showrooms during the stifling summer months.Sales in the world’s biggest car market totalled 2.07 million vehicles in September, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed.The sales drop was due to the domestic power crunch caused partly by the shortage of coal and prolonged global chip shortage that has forced many major automakers to idle or curtail production, said Chen Shihua, a senior official at CAAM.He added that the chip supply shortage eased in China last month and that the industry body now expects the supply to improve further in the final three months this year but constraints would remain.One bright spot in the data was the strong sales of new energy vehicles (NEV), which more than doubled in September to 357,000, thanks to the government’s promotion of greener vehicles to cut pollution. These include battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.Tesla Inc, which is making Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport-utility vehicles in Shanghai, sold 56,006 China-made vehicles in September, the highest since it started production in Shanghai about two years ago, and up 27% from 44,264 in August.Chinese EV makers Nio Inc and Xpeng Inc delivered over 10,000 vehicles each last month. Volkswagen AG said it sold 10,126 ID. series EVs in China in September.Another CAAM official, Xu Haidong, said NEV sales likely to hit three million units this year, up from 1.4 million last year."
1183,11,2021/10,Eetasia,Global PC Shipments Record Sixth Consecutive Quarter of Growth,"Global PC shipments marked their sixth consecutive year-on-year (YoY) growth in the third quarter of 2021 at 84.2 million units. This came despite the ongoing component shortages and other supply constraints. However, the 9.3% YoY growth during the quarter implied decelerating PC shipment momentum after four consecutive quarters of double-digit YoY growth since Q3 2020. In addition, most OEMs and ODMs are not seeing any shrinking gap between orders (demand) and shipments (supply).In Q3 2021, the global PC supply chain remained constrained due to component shortages related to power management IC, radio frequency, audio codec and others. We believe there is no solution to this demand-supply mismatch till mid-2022. ODMs are still pulling in chips inventory to tackle any downside risks. Besides, unstable global logistics and manufacturing site shutdowns in Southeast Asia and China add more uncertainties to PC supplies.PC demand remained solid during the quarter. Commercial PC demand is gradually heating up while consumer PC momentum is decelerating. Chromebook turned out to be the biggest drag during the quarter, as both government and education orders were largely fulfilled in the first half, in addition to the increasing availability of COVID-19 vaccines and reopening of offices and schools across the world. We believe Chromebook demand will not disappear, just take a break this year."
1186,11,2021/10,Eetasia,Component Shortages Drag Down Global Smartphone Market,"Global smartphone shipments fell by 6% in the third quarter of 2021 as vendors struggled to meet demand for devices amid component shortages, according to market analyst Canalys. Samsung was the leading vendor with 23% share. Apple regained second place with 15% share, thanks to strong early demand for iPhone 13. Xiaomi took 14% share for third place, while vivo and OPPO completed the top five with 10% share each.“The chipset famine has truly arrived,” said Canalys Principal Analyst Ben Stanton. “The smartphone industry is striving to maximize production of devices as best it can. On the supply side, chipset manufacturers are increasing prices to disincentivize over-ordering, in an attempt to close the gap between demand and supply. But despite this, shortages will not ease until well into 2022. As a result of this, as well as high costs of global freight, smartphone brands have reluctantly pushed up device retail pricing.”"
1119,11,2021/10,RCR,Ericsson Q3 earnings. Strong 5G sales offset setbacks in China and from chip shortage,"Ericsson has reported third-quarter profit of $665.2 million. The company’s loss of market share in mainland China — due to tensions resulting from Sweden’s ban on Huawei equipment — and global supply chain challenges were offset by strong sales of 5G equipment in much of the world.“We continue to win footprint across our business by leveraging our competitive 5G portfolio. The 5G contracts now awarded by all three tier-1 US carriers are the largest in Ericsson’s history,” commented Börje Ekholm, president and CEO of Ericsson.He further summarized: “Through continuous measures for global supply chain resilience, we avoided customer impact during the first half of the year. However, late in Q3 we saw some impact on sales from disturbances in the supply chain, and such issues will continue to pose a risk. While we continued to gain share in a growing market, the expected sales reduction in Mainland China, lower variable sales in Managed Services and some supply chain disturbances, led to a negative organic sales development of -1%.”Ericsson, though, has secured 5G contracts from all three U.S. telecom firms — Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile US — which has helped the company to absorb its losses in China.However, despite these successes, the company’s total revenue fell 2% to 56.3 billion crowns, missing the 58.14 billion crowns forecast by analysts. Its profits, however, generally exceeded analysts’ expectations. Ekholm reported stable network sales year-over-year, with an increase of 8% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. He also spoke of a 1% growth in digital services sales, saying that excluding sales in Mainland China, these sales increased by 6% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year.“We are starting to see initial revenues from 5G contracts, driving growth in our Core business,” he continued. The company’s gross margin saw a minor drop, “impacted mainly by initial deployment costs in cloud native 5G Core projects,” Ekholm said, adding, “We continue to increase our R&D investments in the 5G portfolio, including Core and orchestration, further strengthening our competitive position.”Ekholm also said that due to the reduced market share in mainland China, Ericsson will “resize” its sales and delivery  delivery organization in the country, starting in the fourth quarter, which would result in restructuring charges."

In addition, the US has not ruled out the possibility in enhancing the normative intensity on Huawei or overall Chinese brands, thus the subsequent impact on wafer foundries may not be optimistic.According to the survey of TrendForce, HiSilicon occupies approximately 20% of wafer starts in TSMC, which are primarily advanced processes below (including) 16/12nm. Currently, HiSilicon’s chips used in 5G base stations and 4G smartphones are manufactured with TSMC’s 16/12nm node. However, it should be pointed out that HiSilicon has shifted a small volume of the wafer starts of Kirin 710 SoC for mid-end smartphones to the 14nm process of SMIC this year.Recommended

Apple begins reopening some stores with temperature checks and other safeguards in placeIn mid-March, Apple closed all of its stores outside of China “until further notice.” In a statement issued today under the title, “To our Customers,” Retail SVP Deirdre O’Brien offered insight into the company’s plans to reopen locations.Nearly 100 stores have already resumed services, according to O’Brien. Face covers will be required for both employees and customers alike. In addition, temperature checks are now conducted at the store’s entrance, coupled with posted health questions. Apple has also instituted deeper cleaning on all surfaces, including display products.2. Huawei admits uncertainty following new US chip curbsFollowing the U.S. government’s announcement that it would further thwart Huawei’s chip-making capability, the Chinese telecoms equipment giant condemned the new ruling for being “arbitrary and pernicious.” Adding to its woes, the Nikkei Asian Review reported that Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has stopped taking new orders from the company. (Huawei declined to comment, while TSMC said the report was “purely market rumor.”)3. Jack Ma to resign from SoftBank Group’s board of directorsThe company did not give a reason for the resignation, but over the past year, Ma has been pulling back from business roles to focus on philanthropy. Last September, he resigned as Alibaba’s chairman, and is also expected to step down from its board at its annual general shareholder’s meeting this year.4.

Based in Hsinchu, Taiwan, TSMC provides chip components for many of the world’s largest semiconductor companies and its U.S. clients include Apple and Qualcomm.White House reportedly in talks with Intel, TSMC to build advanced chip foundries in the USThe plant, scheduled to start production of chips in 2024, will enable TSMC’s American customers to fabricate their semiconductor products domestically. It will use the company’s 5-nanometer technology and is expected to create 1,600 jobs and have the capacity to produce 20,000 wafers a month.The U.S.-China trade war, national security concerns, geopolitical unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic have all underscored the shortfalls of relying on foundries located abroad and international supply chains.The U.S. government has reportedly been in talks with TSMC for months, though one sticking point for the company was the high cost of building a new foundry. TSMC chairman Mark Liu told the New York Times in October that the project would require major subsidies because it is more expensive to operate a factory in the U.S. than in Taiwan.In today’s announcement, TSMC said, “U.S. adoption of forward-looking investment policies to enable a globally competitive environment for a leading edge semiconductor technology operation in the U.S. will be crucial to the success of this project.”The company expects to spend about $12 billion between 2021 and 2029 on the project, with construction slated to begin next year.TSMC already operates a foundry in Camas, Washington, and has design centers in Austin, Texas and San Jose, California.

There’s new Arm flagship processors, a look back at a Bristol startup, a wander down an analogue memory lane, chip production in China and Huawei being ousted from UK networks…5. Arm replaces CPU and GPU flagships, and more
Arm has announced flagship processors for phones: Cortex-X1 CPU, Cortex-A78 CPU, Mali-G78 GPU and Ethos-N78 neural network processor (NPU). Offered as part of Arm’s custom programme, Cortex-X1 is the most powerful Cortex processor yet, according to the company, with 30% greater peak performance over the current Cortex-A77 CPU, as well as 22% single-thread integer performance improvements over the just-announced Cortex-A78. “This short high-performance burst is best for reactivity and responsiveness when using devices, enabling the highest performance ever for smartphones and large screen devices,” said Arm.4. Secret Technology Backed With $10m [Mannerisms]
16 years ago a start-up hit the Bristol streets with a plan to have a billion in revenue by 2020-1. Electronics Weekly reported the event like this: A FABLESS semiconductor start-up has won $10m funding but the firm,which has leading industry executives behind it,is currently keeping its technology under wraps. The Bristol firm, backed by Benchmark Capital and Atlas Venture,will be setting up two engineering teams to support its technology.3.

A veteran of 31 years in the Analogue Integrated Circuit industry, Ash Madni takes a personal look at how rapidly the electronics have evolved over his career, from 1985 with 3GHz Bipolar technology to 300GHz FDSOI and Covid-19…Burlington Vermont in the late 90s was my first visit to the United States. I could barely contain my excitement as we waited at the Inn at Essex Junction in Burlington for the green light to visit IBM Microelectronics. I was not disappointed on our arrival at IBM Burlington, both in terms of its imposing physical appearance and the high level of professionalism of the staff we met there. This was Silicon technology at its best.2. China falling badly short of ‘Made In China 2025’ chip target
IC Insights reckons that China may only achieve about 30% of its ‘Made in China’ target of having 70% of its domestic chip requirement supplied from domestic sources in 2025. China is going to fall a long way short of its ‘Made in China 2025’ target for domestic semiconductor production, says IC Insights. IC production in China represented 15.7% of its $125 billion IC market in 2019, up only slightly from 15.1% five years earlier in 2014. As shown in Figure 1, IC Insights forecasts that this share will increase by 5.0 percentage points to 20.7% in 2024.1. Huawei to be ousted from UK network
Plans to further reduce Huawei’s involvement in UK 5G infrastructure are being drawn up following growing anti-China sentiment in the wake of the coronavirus. BT is already committed to stripping out Huawei equipment from the core of the network by 2023. The core is where voice and data are routed to their destinations across sub-networks and servers, the non-core comprises the antennas and base stations which provide mobile devices with radio access to the core."
1491,17,2012/05,RCR,Here come the Intel smartphones,"Intel (INTC) and China’s Lenovo have launched an Android 2.3 smartphone powered by Intel’s Atom Z2460 processor, and next week a similar Intel-powered smartphone will go on sale in the UK. Lenovo’s LePhone K800 will retail for about $524 on Lenovo’s 360buy.com website. With a 4.5″ screen and high definition 1080p video, the smartphone targets gamers and entertainment enthusiasts. The launch follows last month’s debut of the XOLO X900 in India, the first smartphone with an Intel microprocessor.Meanwhile, Orange UK is set to launch Europe’s first Intel-powered smartphone on June 6. Like the LePhone K800, the Orange San Diego (previously called the Santa Clara) is an Android 2.3 phone powered by Intel’s Atom Z2460 (Medfield) processor, as well as Intel’s XMM 6260 cellular modem. The Intel modem, which the company says is the smallest HSPA+ cellular modem on the market today, supports pentaband UMTS 3G, meaning that the phone should be able to connect to networks worldwide.  The San Diego will be free for customers willing to sign a two-year contract at $24 per month (£15.50). For prepaid customers, the phone will cost about $308 (£199). Orange UK, which is part of Everything Everywhere currently has about 15 million subscribers.The Atom Z2460, a single core 1.6GHz processor, is Intel’s first foray into the smartphone processor market. The company that has dominated chip design for personal computers and servers has gotten something of a slow start in the mobile device market because its chips typically consume more power than those of competitor ARM Holdings (ARMH).
But Intel is racing to catch up, with plans to launch a dual core 32nm version of Atom later this year.Although Intel has a long history of working with Microsoft, the company has partnered with makers of Android phones for its initial launches since Android currently dominates the OS landscape. Android enthusiasts were eager to get their hands on the new devices, and Android Central posted this demo of the San Diego earlier today.Follow me on Twitter"
1483,17,2012/05,RCR,Dell looks to smaller devices for bigger profits,"While Hewlett-Packard adapts to a changing PC market by reducing its workforce, Dell is reducing the size of its products. This week the company tried to temper a disappointing earnings report with promises of smaller, more mobile products later this year.Dell (DELL) saw its stock price skid 17% on Wednesday after the PC maker’s earnings came in below Wall Street’s expectations. Net income fell 42% from the year-ago quarter, while revenue slipped just 4%. Dell earned $635 million on revenue of $14.4 billion during the three months ending in April.Dell is losing business as tablets and even smartphones replace much of the work that PCs once did. The Texas company that was started in a college dorm room is moving quickly to adapt to the mobile landscape – Dell has launched a line of tablets and even a smartphone in China. Here in the United States, Dell is working with longtime partner Intel to define the ultrabook product category.Intel, which has trademarked the “ultrabook” name, requires those devices to be less than .8-inches thick and to use its chip architecture. Other specs insure that sub-notebooks marketed as ultrabooks are fast and use power efficiently. Dell’s XPS 13 Ultrabook has garnered good reviews, but faces competition from cheaper versions made by Acer, Samsung and Toshiba. Furthermore, competitors using chipsets from AMD and ARM are moving into the market with thin, inexpensive competitors to the ultrabook.Microsoft’s Windows 8 may kickstart Dell’s ultrabook and tablet businesses when it is released later this year. For years, Microsoft, Intel and Dell were a formidable team in the enterprise PC market, and many of those customers are eagerly awaiting the release of Windows 8. During Dell’s earnings call yesterday, CEO Michael Dell said he expects customers to buy new devices to take advantage of the touchscreen capabilities of Windows 8. He says Dell will be ready with ultrabooks as well as new tablets.Follow me on Twitter"

1649,20,2006/07,RCR,History lessons,"While the standards-setting process for WiMAX technology seems to move forward at a snail’s pace, the business machinations around mobile WiMAX are developing faster than a speeding bullet, so to speak.Indeed, Intel Corp.’s recent moves to exit the wireless handset chip business and immediately turn around and plunk down $600 million to invest in wireless broadband service provider Clearwire Corp.-and Motorola Inc.’s decision to then acquire Clearwire’s infrastructure provider NextNet Wireless Inc.-gives some guidance on how this controversial technology could develop in the not-so-distant future.WiMAX is not a guaranteed success, but it’s getting legs. The fact that the UMTS TDD Forum is sending out e-mails highlighting its deficiencies leads me to believe that they think it’s got some power.A slide entitled “Wireless Convergence is a Myth” from Texas Instruments Wireless Infrastructure Group says it best. The industry is always moving forward with new standards, and old standards are not going away. Carriers will continue to support GSM even as they roll out HSDPA.When CDMA and GSM were competing head-to-head for second-generation deployments, no one had heard of the terms LTE or WiMAX. OFDM has been around a long time, but never at the front and center of the industry.Today, wireless players are arguing internally about which version of wireless broadband technology should be deployed, and likely a few versions will be commercially deployed.The Intel/Clearwire/Motorola announcement reminds me of Motorola’s initial foray into the SMR business. Motorola built the network, manufactured the handsets, and even operated the networks-Motorola single-handedly created an industry.Later when the industry was running smoothly, Motorola sold its operations to Nextel Communications Inc. A little later, Craig McCaw invested more than $1 billion in Nextel, and the company moved from one proprietary technology to a better one-iDENToday, it looks like Intel is employing a similar strategy with wireless broadband: Intel is bankrolling McCaw’s Clearwire, and Motorola is taking over Clearwire’s proprietary technology, which has committed to deploying WiMAX technology built by Motorola.Results: Intel will have a network and a service provider using its chips."
1620,20,2006/07,RCR,Nokia clinging to U.S. CDMA position with ODMs,"The dissolution of the Nokia Corp./Sanyo Electronics Co. Ltd. CDMA joint venture may leave a void in the United States for CDMA handsets, estimated by analysts at about 7 million units per year, despite Nokia assurances that its alternative strategy for the prized U.S. market includes reliance on original design manufacturers. Nokia has yet to announce the specifics of its plans for CDMA in the United States, however, lending an element of uncertainty to discussions on the potential reshaping of the U.S. market.The JV’s implosion in the view of some analysts has offered opportunities for gains in U.S. CDMA market share by LG Electronics Co. Ltd., Nokia’s likely ODM partner, Pantech Group, and, possibly, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.. In each case, the introduction of a Motorola Inc. Razr handset by CDMA operator Verizon Wireless stole unit shipments and market share from the leading competitors.While Nokia is forming and executing a new U.S. CDMA strategy, a strong marketing push by Kyocera Wireless Corp. in the next three quarters could steal away Nokia’s stock keeping unit (a designation that represents a specific model) at Sprint Nextel Corp. and Verizon Wireless, which might be receptive to Kyocera, according to Strategy Analytics’ Chris Ambrosio.LG stands to gain in entry-tier models at Sprint Nextel—if it can overcome Kyocera’s competition—as LG’s presence at the industry’s No.3 operator recently has grown, Ambrosio said.But, according to Strategy Analytics’ Neil Mawston, LG has reached a glass ceiling with its existing CDMA distribution network. LG must offer converged devices and improve its position at Sprint Nextel, Mawston said. Samsung, relieved of the JV’s competitive pressures, still must address entry-level phones in its CDMA portfolio, as Samsung currently concentrates on the high-end market.Ironically, rounding out Strategy Analytics’ take on the issue, Nokia had been gaining ground in North America in recent quarters, gaining 5-percent market share and selling 1 million more CDMA phones in the low- and mid-tier in the first quarter, compared to the year-ago quarter.Current Analysis’ Avi Greengart issued his firm’s take on the dissolved JV. “Nokia hopes to minimize CDMA investment while treading water in the strategically important U.S. market … while it waits for a new, non-Qualcomm technology to replace CDMA,” he wrote. “It could be a long wait … re-badged Pantech phones cannot truly reflect Nokia’s brand promise and are sure to be hammered by competitors.”Meanwhile, Greengart suggested that because the majority of U.S. subscribers are on CDMA networks and Nokia’s “owners”—i.e., shareholders—”live on Wall Street,” exiting a market where there’s enormous potential is a mistake. Nokia’s enterprise mobility strategy in the U.S., moreover, is “severely wounded, if not completely dead.”Greengart said Nokia’s decision has a significant Qualcomm angle. As he wrote in his report, “Nokia needs to hire some new IP lawyers with absolutely no wireless background—or baggage—and let them approach Qualcomm and its licensing terms with fresh eyes. Nobody else in the industry interprets Qualcomm’s licensing terms the way that Nokia does.”Qualcomm received a good deal of attention as news spread that the JV would be dissolved. For one thing, the JV would have formed the world’s largest single CDMA handset vendor and undoubtedly strengthened Qualcomm’s hand in the CDMA chip market. Because Qualcomm and Nokia are locked into a protracted negotiation over cross-licensing—a current agreement expires in April 2007—and have both lodged lawsuits against each other involving intellectual property rights on both the CDMA and GSM sides of the wireless market, it’s natural to assume as many have that the JV and the ongoing IPR spats are linked. Nokia and Qualcomm have both side-stepped the issue of linkage, while stressing the fundamental strengths of their ongoing businesses.Though news of the JV’s dissolution temporarily rocked Qualcomm’s stock price, the CDMA chip maker’s chief executive officer, Paul Jacobs, insisted to the press that Nokia’s decision had more to do with its inability to profit in CDMA markets than with a pessimistic view of the health of those markets. (For the record, Nokia’s statement said that, in addition to slim margins, a “financially prohibitive CDMA ecosystem”—possible code for Qualcomm’s licensing terms—and recent developments in the business case for CDMA in emerging markets had led it to dissolve the JV.)Jacobs also said that he saw no connection between the dissolved JV and Nokia and Qualcomm’s long-running squabbles and legal thrust-and-parry. Yet Jacobs did brandish the possibility, however remote, that if the European Commission investigates Nokia and other parties’ claims that Qualcomm’s licensing practices are unfair and grants an injunction hindering Qualcomm’s chip business, he might be prepared to split his company into two businesses—one devoted to selling chips, the other to licensing IPR—to avoid an interruption to his business while EC injunctions are dealt with.In an interview last week, Cristiano Amon, a Qualcomm vice president for product management, reiterated that his firm sees plenty of growth potential in the U.S. market, that competitors would take up any slack left by Nokia’s change of heart, that growth in entry-level handset sales in India was robust and aided by sub-$50 CDMA handsets—never mind flat growth in China and other CDMA markets documented by Strategy Analytics—and that the sheer volume of CDMA subscribers (312 million worldwide and 112 million in the U.S.) bodes well for the market.The CDMA Development Group, not surprisingly, echoed these views. As for China, according to James Person, the CDG’s point man on Asia, it too will come along.“The only slowing market internationally that I can think of is China,” Person said. “That’s a case of continued delay in awarding 3G licenses. We do believe those licenses will be awarded by early 2007, because the Summer Olympics will be held in Beijing in 2008 and Beijing definitely wants to look good with 3G before that happens.”"
1647,20,2006/07,RCR,"Clearwire, 802.16e bolstered by Intel $600M investment","The combined $900 million investment in Clearwire Corp. from Intel Capital and Motorola Ventures establishes that 802.16e technology will be a force in mobile wireless broadband service. Under the investment deal announced last week, Intel plans to invest $600 million into Craig McCaw’s Clearwire operations, which already provides wireless broadband service in 27 metro areas in 12 states. The investment, which Intel said is its largest investment ever, should help to promote the deployment of WiMAX technology-as well as the sale of Intel’s WiMAX chips. Indeed, Clearwire previously announced plans to use Intel’s WiMAX equipment eventually. Today, Clearwire uses a proprietary pre-WiMAX technology provided by subsidiary NextNet Wireless Inc.Intel’s deal with Clearwire likely ensures that the 802.16e flavor of mobile WiMAX takes off. Clearwire has previously voiced its intent to migrate its network to the WiMAX standard.Indeed, Clearwire now has an extra $900 million to build out its network, which eliminates the company’s need for an initial public offering. Clearwire filed for a $400 million IPO in May.Having carried the torch for 802.16e’s ratification, Intel now seems well-positioned to reap chip profits from the deployment of the technology.During an interview with RCR Wireless News, Scott Richardson, vice president and general manager of Intel’s Service Provider business group, pointed out that Intel’s WiMAX strategy is similar to its successful Wi-Fi strategy of investing in Wi-Fi players, which resulted in “making Wi-Fi synonymous with Centrino.” Centrino is Intel’s Wi-Fi product.“We put money into players in the ecosystem that help facilitate our technology position,” Richardson said.Richardson noted that he expects to see significant WiMAX adoption in 2007 in both emerging and mature markets.He added fixed WiMAX will likely be adopted in emerging markets like China and India, while mobile WiMAX likely will take off in mature markets throughout Western Europe as well as in large Asian cities.“Mobile WiMAX as a standard is moving along very quickly, but it can take multiple years to build out the infrastructure for a new technology. This announcement signifies that two big companies, Intel and Motorola, are committed to WiMAX,” Richardson said.However, it’s not clear which types of wireless products will house Intel’s mobile WiMAX chips. Intel’s chips likely will dominate WiMAX-enabled laptops, but handsets are quite another story. Consider the recent wranglings between Intel and Qualcomm Inc., the owner of Flarion Technologies and its Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing technology, which it claims is the underlying technology behind WiMAX. Qualcomm has not been shy about announcing royalty-bearing licensing agreements for WiMAX products. Further, Qualcomm has said it intends to collect royalties from a variety of WiMAX equipment vendors, which could include Intel.It’s also interesting to note the timing and dollar amount of Intel’s sale of its smart-phone chips business unit to Marvell Technology Group Ltd. The sale was announced in late June and totals exactly the same amount as Intel agreed to pay for its interest in Clearwire-$600 million.And then there’s Motorola. The company is essentially paying around $300 million to buy Clearwire’s NextNet business.Clearwire purchased NextNet, which makes non-line-of-sight equipment based on OFDM technology, to control the development of its network infrastructure. Going forward, Clearwire said it plans to use Motorola equipment to build out its broadband wireless network.During a conversation that took place one day before the Clearwire announcement, Motorola’s Paul Sergeant, the company’s senior marketing manager, told RCR Wireless News that he didn’t feel that Motorola had any gaps in what he called its “end-to-end WiMAX portfolio.” So why then would Motorola buy NextNet? Is there a behind-the-scenes deal involving handsets and other mobile devices as Clearwire rolls out WiMAX services?In their joint press release, Clearwire, Intel and Motorola said the transaction will ultimately accelerate deployment of 802.16e-2005-based mobile WiMAX networks and technology. There was no mention of handsets.Skylight Research summed up Motorola’s interest in NextNet as being spectrum-sensitive and infrastructure-minded.“With NextNet on board, Motorola combines a strong portfolio for unlicensed bands and a growing global presence with a growing equipment supplier for licensed bands. The deal is mutually beneficial as it gives Motorola an immediate foot in the door with licensed equipment and a customer who has the potential to change the competitive landscape of North American operators.”In addition, Skylight Research speculated that Motorola may be attempting to crank up the pressure on Sprint Nextel to get off the fence and commit to Motorola’s WiMAX offering for its 2.5 GHz spectrum.“It’s no coincidence that prior to this transaction, Motorola was already a leading, maybe the leading, WiMAX contender in Sprint’s evaluation of technologies for the 2.5 GHz band,” stated Skylight. “If Sprint chooses Motorola’s .16e equipment, Clearwire benefits from roaming privileges without interoperability issues (which might be a reason for Sprint to make that selection as well). There are two questions on everyone’s minds. Is this an Intel strategy to provide an insurance policy for WiMAX because Sprint is favoring another mobile technology? Or is this a clever tactic to influence Sprint’s decision toward WiMAX in the interest of nationwide roaming? After all, interoperability, even in the earliest stages of equipment, will not be an issue if one vendor is supplying two large operators owning 2.5 GHz spectrum.”Sprint Nextel is also considering wireless broadband technology from Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Flarion and IPWireless Inc. RCR"
1622,20,2006/07,RCR,Russian reseller picks up Aperto solution,"WiMAX base-station and subscriber unit developer Aperto Networks Inc. inked a deal to ship its WiMAX Forum-certified products to Alvacom, a leading systems integrator and equipment reseller in Russia. The contract underscores that regions outside the United States and Europe likely will be first to deploy WiMAX services. Indeed, Alvacom has lined up several Russian service providers to take part in pilot projects and trials during the next three months aiming to cover different end-user and vertical market segments as well as differing geographic areas, such as dense metropolitan areas and places there is no cable or fiber infrastructure.Infoseti, a Russian Internet service provider, plans to trial Aperto’s WiMAX Forum-certified PacketMAX solution in Moscow. Infoseti already has deployed Aperto’s PacketWAVE solution-the company’s proprietary precursor to its certified solution. Infoseti said it has amassed a business user base of more than 1,000 enterprises by delivering a variety of 5.8 GHz high-speed wireless data transmission services, Internet access, Wi-Fi networking, VPNs, videoconferencing and Voice over Internet Protocol features.Aperto’s Manish Gupta, vice president of marketing and alliances, said Aperto has taken part in trials in several countries, including Brazil, India, Indonesia and Spain. Gupta said he believes privately held Aperto will fill a significant amount of orders for its WiMAX equipment in the next several months as service providers in emerging markets look to connect the unconnected. The world’s largest markets, China and India, won’t be among the first customers for WiMAX networks, Gupta noted, but said he thinks WiMAX will be mainstream in time for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. India also should see an incredible amount of WiMAX deployments once that country works out its spectrum allocation policies, he ventured.Cost is a major factor impacting network development in emerging markets, as areas that need coverage tend to be either densely populated urban centers or vast, sparsely populated rural landscapes, both of which are expensive to cover with cellular service.However, Gupta noted that certification of WiMAX equipment has brought prices down. “Until certification, the economics never made sense,” Gupta commented.“We don’t believe that mobile WiMAX is the primary use of WiMAX in the marketplace,” Gupta said. “We see fixed WiMAX as an alternative to DSL, for which 802.16d technology is sufficient. We’ve gone to market with 802.16d, and when operators can decide to upgrade to 802.16e, they can do so by installing an 802.16e card, and they won’t have to replace any equipment.”However, when service providers are ready to upgrade to mobile WiMAX, Gupta explained that Aperto’s base stations, equipped with Intel Corp. chips, can be outfitted with cards that upgrade the units to 802.16e functionality.Gupta acknowledged that Aperto’s success with WiMAX contracts will undoubtedly bring about merger-and-acquisition chatter, but he also said that the startup firm could choose to go public. Aperto has raised more than $120 million in corporate and venture capital funds during multiple rounds of financing, which began in 1999. Though the company has yet to post a profit, Gupta said he expects the company to do so next year."

AT&T takes a Leap; Ericsson debuts the Radio Dot; US leads in LTE subs í¡ this week in 2013,"Editor’s Note: RCR Wireless News goes all in for “Throwback Thursdays,” tapping into our archives to resuscitate the top headlines from the past. Fire up the time machine, put on the sepia-tinted shades, set the date for #TBT and enjoy the memories!AT&T takes a Leap; RWA objectsAT&T’s pending attempt to acquire Leap Wireless gained a new foe as the recently re-branded Rural Wireless Association said it has filed comments with the Federal Communications Commission asking that a “reasonable” spectrum cap be considered before moving forward on the deal. “If the proposed transaction is allowed to proceed, RWA argues that AT&T not be allowed to hold more than 25% of the suitable and available spectrum in any given county post transaction,” RWA noted in a statement. “RWA believes that the commission should review this proposed takeover through the prism of a spectrum aggregation rule that supports at least four equally healthy competitors per market and that any spectrum held by AT&T exceeding this amount should be divested or leased to another operator.” The Leap deal will see AT&T acquire 1.9 GHz and 1.7/2.1 GHz spectrum licenses covering approximately 137 million potential customers, with plans to retain the Leap brand and integrate Leap’s approximately five million customers. RWA, which earlier this month re-branded from its previous Rural Telecommunications Group name, added that if the FCC does not impose a spectrum aggregation limit on AT&T, it should require the carrier to provide data roaming at rates similar to what it charges its mobile virtual network operator partners; offer AT&T customers devices that are interoperable in “all paired spectrum bands;” and allow devices to be unlocked and compatible with the networks of tier-two and tier-three carriers using the same technology. … Read moreGetting familiar with fiberTower technicians may not yet be as comfortable with fiber as they are with cable, but as subscribers demand more and more from their networks, it is clear that fiber is the future. “The numbers speak for themselves as we talk about the move to LTE and the move to smartphones,” said Steve Shaw, director of mobile solutions marketing at Juniper Networks. “Rolling out fiber in the access network and actually stringing fiber directly to the cell site has become quite common for operators making this transition to LTE.” “In the past everyone always thought fiber was so delicate,” said Omar Flores, global business development manager for 3M’s wireless access division. But 3M believes that will change, and the company is encouraging its customers to splice fiber at the cell site in order to customize their installations. “3M is a big, big proponent of bringing field mounted connectivity,” said Flores. “3M has been providing splicing technologies for fiber and copper connectivity in the wireline side of the business, so it just came naturally for us to bring those technologies into the wireless side.” Flores believes that crews can save time and money by splicing fiber just as they cut cable. … Read moreEricsson intros the Radio Dot Ericsson has entered the small cell battle, launching its Radio Dot System that is expected to be available late next year and garnering early interest in the product from Verizon Wireless. The company boasted of a disk-shaped radio small enough to fit in someone’s hand but able to provide high-quality mobile broadband and voice service indoors. Ericsson said the Radio Dot System has a “compelling evolution path” and is aimed at supporting users in medium-to-large indoor locations, and giving a “complete indoor solution” to mobile operators. Ericsson said that current indoor solutions are built mainly for voice coverage, but don’t meet the capacity demands for data and are limited in scalability. Johan Wibergh, head of Ericsson Business Unit Networks, noted that “leading operators are focusing on indoor capacity as an opportunity to address the mobile data demands of their customers and expand their enterprise opportunities. We saw there was a gap. Today’s indoor solutions do not address the vast range of public venues and enterprise buildings that operators are targeting. With the Radio Dot System, we’ve filled this gap and redefined the small cell market.” Verizon Wireless has already stepped up to show its interest in testing and trialing the Radio Dot System. Kris Rinne, senior VP of network and product planning at AT&T Services Inc., noted that small cells are a “key component of AT&T’s Project VIP network enhancement program” and called the Radio Dot System “another tool to choose from in its next-generation toolkit.” So Ericsson sees the new product as a redefinition of the market, saying it has been in development for two years and includes 14 patents. … Read moreT-Mo, Sprint offer dueling unlimited plansT-Mobile US is currently one of two nationwide operators offering flat-rate, unlimited data services to smartphone customers, an offering the carrier is not exactly wedded to, though thinks it can be used to drive additional margins. Speaking at this week’s Goldman Sachs investor conference, T-Mobile US Chief Marketing Officer Mike Sievert told attendees that while the carrier does indeed provide unlimited as an option, that offering is not its reason for being. The comment seemed directed at rival Sprint, which is the other operator offering a flat-rate, unlimited data plan for customers, something that the carrier uses as a prominent marketing message. In fact, Sprint earlier this year unveiled new rate plans that guarantee customers will continue having access to unlimited data for as long as they keep the line of service. Sprint has repeatedly said it does not think unlimited data will be something it can offer indefinitely, but has so far been unable to break itself out of the mold in an attempt to attract customers. That need to move away from unlimited could be pushed off by the carrier’s recent acquisition of Clearwire, which brings a large portfolio of 2.5 GHz spectrum that can used to bolster capacity in high-traffic markets. Sievert noted that for T-Mobile US, unlimited is just one envelope of its offering that it expects will continue driving increased margins for the carrier. The carrier plans to continue offering that option to customers looking for peace of mind, especially those currently on a tiered plan offered by larger rivals, but that the pricing model for the offer could change over time. … Read moreUS leads in LTE subscribers, but is fourth in penetrationThe United States leads the world in the number of LTE subscribers, but in terms of LTE penetration the United States is in fourth place behind South Korea, Japan and Australia. A global LTE heat map (below) produced by Juniper Networks shows that in South Korea almost two thirds of the population has access to LTE, versus roughly a fifth of the population in Japan, Australia and the United States. More than half the world still has 2G service, or no service at all. Outside of North America, Europe, India and China, most 3G and LTE nodes are concentrated in coastal areas. High speed connectivity is often much less expensive for consumers outside North America. Steve Shaw, director of mobile solutions marketing at Juniper, discussed bandwidth pricing with RCR; his comments are below the heat map. Juniper’s Steve Shaw points out that connecting subscribers to mobile broadband is more profitable for U.S. operators than for their cohorts in other parts of the world. “Today a gigabit of traffic on Verizon’s network is something on the order of $7.00, $7.50 a gig, in some markets it’s as low as $1.00 or less, and so in those particular cases just pricing based on bandwidth isn’t enough,” said Shaw. … Read moreInside the iPhone 5sA look under the hood of the iPhone 5s suggests that Apple once again turned to archrival Samsung to manufacture the processor inside its flagship smartphone.

1742,21,2021/09,RCR,Kagan. Qualcomm shows 5G wireless helps environmental sustainability,"Qualcomm recently released a new report titled, “Environmental Sustainability and a Greener Economy: The transformative role of 5G.” This report points to the many ways new 5G wireless technology will benefit the earth, the environment and each and every one of us by achieving sustainability benefits. So, Qualcomm is calling for joint efforts by industry and the government to accelerate 5G adoption.The transformation from 4G to 5G is already on schedule, but this time it will benefit more than just wireless carriers, smartphone and tablet makers and the wireless industry in general. This time, 5G will impact a much wider range of companies and industries and people and will indeed change our lives and our society and the way we live, work, get around and communicate.Qualcomm report: Environmental Sustainability and a Greener EconomyAnd 5G is only the beginning of this transformation. This will continue and accelerate moving forward as we go to 6G, 7G and beyond.We have already seen industry partnerships develop as 5G continues to grow like 5GAA. The 5G Automotive Association. This is a group with member companies who range from wireless equipment makers like Qualcomm, Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia, Intel, LG and Cisco, to networks like Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T, and smartphone and tablet makers like Apple, Samsung, ZTE as well as automobile manufacturers like Ford, Honda, GM, Volvo and many other companies and industries who are all part of the process of transforming the automobile industry and the self-driving world.Qualcomm, Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia, Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T, Cisco, IntelThe report shows how 5G is transforming and having a positive impact on other industries here in the United States and in fact, around the world. This highlights new products, services and processes that are supportive of environmental sustainability. Many people are surprised how enabling sustainability is an economic opportunity. Qualcomm says it is because it helps increase revenues, profit margins and productivity among other benefits.5G wireless means many different industries can increase overall sustainability because it improves greenhouse gas emissions, water usage and waste, pesticide usage, energy usage and more. Accelerated deployment of 5G will ensure environmental sustainability An accelerated deployment of 5G products, services and networks will help to ensure sustainability advantages going forward. There are many environmental benefits the 5G wireless rollout will bring to the world. In the United States, Qualcomm says it will create as many as 300,000 new green jobs by 2030. They also say the roles of data scientist, data engineer and software engineer will gain traction going forward as companies rely more on 5G. This report also says we will save 410 billion gallons of water, nationwide. This is the equivalent of water usage in more than four million homes.

At the heart of the confusion is a piece of technology known as a Trusted Platform Module, or TPM.The job of TPM chips is to perform cryptographic operations that provide security at a hardware level and verify the authenticity of a system at launch. They also feature various mechanisms to make them resistant to tampering.Among other specifications relating to the CPU, RAM and storage, Windows 11 will require all machines to feature TPM 2.0 support, either built into the CPU or in the form of an additional chip connected to the motherboard.Here's our list of the best antivirus services aroundTake a look at our list of the best ransomware protection out thereCheck out our list of the best endpoint protection softwareThe announcement sent PC owners scrambling to find out whether their device supports TPM and, in some cases, how to switch it on in the BIOS.

According to Jorge Myszne, founder and CEO of semiconductor startup Kameleon, TPM is already an anachronistic technology.“TPM is from 2003; it was good enough 20 years ago, but think about everything that has changed in terms of infrastructure over the last two decades,” he told TechRadar Pro.While the TPM standard has evolved significantly since its inception (the latest TPM 2.0 update was published in 2019) thanks to input from a range of organizations, Myszne suggests this approach to security suffers from a fundamental flaw.“The main challenge is that the TPM is a passive device; while you can store data there and nobody can see it, in order to do something with that data the software needs access. And if the software has access, an attacker can gain access too.”Firmware securityFounded in 2019 and backed by Xilinx, a pioneer in the field of programmable SoCs, Kameleon’s objective is to reverse the dynamics of cybercrime, by handing the advantage to the defender.Although the company is yet to bring a product to market, it is working on a piece of hardware called a Proactive Security Processing Unit (ProSPU) that it hopes can combat the threat of firmware attacks, which are increasing in volume and sophistication.“The most common types of attacks take the form of applications that target the upper layers, but these have been fairly successfully blocked,” Myszne explained. “As a result, attackers are becoming more specialized, heading down the stack towards the firmware; attacks here are both difficult to detect and persistent.”Recent figures from Microsoft show that 80% of organizations have suffered at least one firmware attack over the last couple of years. However, less than a third of security funding is set aside to protect firmware, and 21% of security chiefs even admit that firmware goes totally unmonitored.(Image credit: Shutterstock / Gorodenkoff)The problem with attacks of this kind is that they cannot be identified and blocked by software. At launch, a system is booted in increments, starting with a small footprint of code that loads into the CPU, followed by a larger pool of code, then eventually the operating system loads from the hard drive or network.“Any compromise that takes place during this process is completely undetectable. Software isn’t even running yet, so it has no way of checking what’s going on,” noted Myszne.The solution to this problem, he says, is to have a dedicated device in charge of the security of a system. In the same way GPUs handle graphics and TPUs handle AI workloads, a security processor is tasked with establishing a “root of trust” by checking that all firmware is authentic.A dedicated security processorDesigned for servers and data center use cases, Kameleon’s ProSPU aims to remedy the kinds of problems that arise as a result of the reliance of TPM chips (and other equivalents) on software for instruction.Whereas TPMs are passive, creating an opportunity for infiltration by an attacker, the ProSPU is master of the system, performing active checks to verify each element of the boot process is authentic. Many chips on the market already perform their own secure boot, Myszne concedes, but there’s nothing out there that “pokes around in all the different places”.As well as establishing this root of trust, the ProSPU provides crypto services to software (e.g. key generation, key management, encryption and decryption), and runtime security to detect and prevent attacks.With direct access to the memory, beneath the OS, the ProSPU can operate outside the view of potential hackers. Because it doesn’t rely on APIs for access, there is nothing for an attacker to infect.“The first thing an attacker does is attempt to understand the system and defences. In this case, the defence is running on a different system entirely, with direct access beneath the software,” said Myszne.“The attacker doesn’t know what’s going on and now needs to attack the system without an understanding of the defences. And because attackers don’t like risk, they will go elsewhere.”Future of hardware securityAsked whether he thinks Microsoft made the wrong decision by mandating TPM 2.0 support for Windows 11, Myszne nodded in agreement.“If I was working on an enterprise-level operating system, then yes, but for a generic OS like Windows it’s a big bet, because there will be problems,” he said.“Usually, TPMs are disabled by default, because they are difficult to manage; you need to know what you’re doing or else risk bricking your computer. How many people know how to fiddle with the BIOS safely?”Although Myszne concedes that a TPM is better than nothing from a security perspective, he suggests the combination of poor user experience and an insufficient level of protection mean the requirement will be more hassle than it’s worth.“The system is not a single chip device as it used to be 20 years ago. We need hardware security infrastructure to evolve for the needs of today, as well as the needs of the next five to ten years.”Kameleon expects an alpha version of the ProSPU to land by the end of the year, and to be inside servers by H1 2022. Although applications of the technology are most urgent in data center contexts, due to the concentration of risk, Myszne predicts ProSPU-style hardware will filter down into the consumer, industrial and automotive markets within the next two to three years.“There’s a lot to defend out there,” he said.Update: September 13, 10:00am BSTThis article has been updated to reflect the continued evolution of the TPM standard.Here's our list of the best cloud backup services"

In other words, once a customer is locked into the ecosystem, it would take a significant performance leap or price drop to incentivize a switch.The company benefits from a couple of distinct advantages over its rival: scale and in-house manufacturing capabilities.Unlike AMD, Intel is an integrated device manufacturer, which means the company both designs and manufactures its semiconductors in-house. While AMD is reliant on TSMC’s oversubscribed 7nm manufacturing process, Intel has much tighter control over its own supply.There is also a massive revenue disparity between the two firms (Intel took in $77.9 billion in 2020, while AMD generated a comparatively small $9.7 billion) and Intel has a more diverse collection of revenue streams. This financial firepower gives Intel an additional measure of freedom and flexibility unavailable to its competitor.Of course, Intel will look to step on AMD’s toes in the GPU market too, potentially in both a datacenter and consumer context.

1758,21,2021/09,RCR,Challenges in midband spectrum,"In every spectrum band, there are some sort of challenges that wireless systems have to deal with: Limited channel bandwidth, passive intermodulation, propagation or in-building penetration issues, to name a few. The midband is no exception, and it has some unique characteristics and usage rules that will shape how and where it is deployed over time. Let’s break down some of them.The amount of bandwidth is a boon – but some strings are attached in using it. Nick Karter, director of product strategy for Analog Devices, points out that the midband provides the opportunity for large swaths of contiguous spectrum and that requirements are being discussed to provide channels that are 200 to 400 megahertz — the first time this is available outside of mmWave frequencies. That presents new challenges for filters and other RF components and requirements that have to be met by both mobile devices and base stations. Rex Chen, director for 5G business development at test equipment company LitePoint, says that his company is seeing instances where chipsets can support, say, 200 megahertz of bandwidth – but in actual deployments, carriers (used to five, 10 or 20-megahertz channels in previous Gs) aren’t using that entire capability because they’re still testing to make sure it works for across-the-board deployment.Another thing that is changing in 5G, according to Chen, is the way that data is being consumed: The typical emphasis on the downlink is evolving.  The increase in remote work, video conferencing and so on, means that uplink capabilities are becoming more important. This in turn, he says, is leading carriers and chipset makers to re-think how they mix and match spectrum resources: “One of the ideas is that, now that I have more uplink requirements, if my low-band is very congested, maybe I have the downlink on the midband and the uplink is on the low-band, or vice versa. We’ve also seen from the chipset side, as they talk about carrier aggregation, besides contiguous and non-contiguous bands, they’ve also proposed that maybe we can carrier-aggregate millimeter-wave and sub-6. Or again, mix and match.” While LitePoint hasn’t noted any particular behavioral quirks to the midband itself, he says, there is inherent variety in the use cases for 5G that may also end up making deployment challenging: Do you choose to build for coverage (important for smartphones and mobility) or high-capacity data (necessary for FWA)? “We know that as a whole, 5G isn’t just addressing the smartphone market,” Chen says. “Smartphones are definitely an important market, but we’re seeing fixed wireless access [and]  IoT modules in this space. With the different devices that are coming out, the requirements are also quite different: Some, it’s coverage; some, it’s, you need a lot of data. … I think the variety of these device requirements has made the carriers understand that we need this midband to be part of our 5G strategy moving forward.”Variation of power levels in the band. While the C-Band and 3.45 GHz spectrum rules allow high-power operations – which is the preference of mobile network operators – the 150 megahertz of shared CBRS spectrum has vastly different, and lower, power limitations. That doesn’t mean it won’t be used or can’t be aggregated, but it does mean that CBRS has limitations in a macro-cell context.This spectrum sits squarely in the middle of the 3-4 GHz range and has been designated for full-power 5G transmission in many countries; the tiered incumbent-sharing system, which the U.S. pioneered, hasn’t really caught on broadly around the globe. However, the CBRS PALs auction was arguably successful simply from the number and diversity of bidders that it brought in, with more than 228 winners. CBRS is serving an important role as the U.S.’ play to provide non-carrier businesses with the opportunity to use desirable spectrum for private networks. Spectrum regulators in other countries, such as Germany and France, have instead reserved small portions of their midband spectrum allocations to be licensed to enterprises.However, there are some practical concerns about the significant differences in power levels across the band. Some are worried that once the 3.45-3.55 GHz band can be used, the higher power levels allowed in that band will cause interference problems for the lower channels of the CBRS band.Dish Network (which bought the most CBRS licenses) argued in a March 2021 filing to the FCC that the power level imbalance across the band “[leaves] a relatively encumbered CBRS band sandwiched between the 3.45 GHz Band and the 3.7 GHz Band, both of which … have services rules optimized for large-scale, wide-channel 5G service offerings. This is akin to connecting two cities with a new 8-lane high-speed roadway, but constructing a stretch of single lane road in the middle. The current U.S. approach undermines the overall usefulness of the entire 3 GHz band, and places the United States at odds with our major global competitors, especially China.” In particular, Dish fretted that CBRS’ far lower-power operations would encounter “blocking interference” from 3.45 GHz (both of them are TDD bands) and asked the FCC – as have a number of other companies – to create new, higher power limit categories for CBRS. While “careful network planning and coordination among spectrum users” may limit the harms to CBRS, the most efficient and logical solution is to increase the ceiling for CBRS power limits to place it in parity with its neighbor,” the company said. Dish isn’t the first and probably won’t be the last to ask the FCC to consider higher CBRS power limits, but thus far, the agency has not indicated that it plans to change the rules.Cost of deployment. Midband spectrum costs alone are stacking up: $4.58 billion raised in the CBRS PALs auction; a whopping $81.2 billion in the C-Band auction and a reserve price of about $14.8 billion for the 3.45 GHz auction. Those are substantial costs for operators, and on top of them come the costs of actual build-out. Luke Getto, director of product management at passive and power components company VoltServer, says that midband deployments are likely to be less expensive than mmWave for multiple reasons: The components are less expensive, operators don’t have to deploy as many sites because midband propagation is better and also, that vendors have been more forward-looking in their support roadmaps as carriers have made it clear that want to see plug-and-play readiness for things like CBRS. He expects C-Band to be treated similarly, and for it to be deployed on existing infrastructure first, in order to reduce the upfront deployment costs. While 5G in mmWave required a complete overlay, he said that CBRS is being deployed in such a way that the radios get put up, plugged in and then function as best they can in the existing system. Carriers, he went on, “only have so much money. They’ve got to look for economical ways of deploying it,” he continued. Midband coverage will probably be good enough that they can, much like in LTE, put up radios on existing infrastructure first and then decide later if they need to densify with additional sites. “They’re going to get both the coverage and capacity they need, but they’re not going to look to overlay an entire new radio architecture, in my opinion,” Getto said.Coexisting with incumbents. While this aspect of network planning is most obvious in the CBRS band, with its three-tiered sharing levels and coastal sensor network that picks up use by itinerant naval radar systems for which other users must vacate the band, it’s not absent from either C-Band or the upcoming 3.45 GHz band. Satellite operators are busy repacking their operations to move into the top 200 megahertz of the band (4.0-4.2 GHz), protected by a 20-megahertz guard band, which require modification of existing equipment including filtering and re-orientation to mitigate interference. But C-Band licensees also have to do their own due diligence to check for registered Earth stations (there are about 16,000 of them across the U.S.) and make sure that their terrestrial network designs don’t generate out-of-band emissions that will interfere with those stations’ ability to operate. In the 3.45 GHz band, there are nearly three dozen areas around the country with federal incumbent systems where network operators will have to coordinate their use of the spectrum and may be restricted or at least, not entitled to interference protection from those systems. Those areas, according to NTIA and the FCC, are “limited in size and scope and include military training facilities, test sites, Navy home ports, and shipyards.” The Department of Defense has been using the 3.45 GHz band for high- and low-powered radar systems, including fixed, mobile, shipborne and airborne systems, as well as testing and training related to those systems. The places with federal incumbent systems have been dubbed Cooperative Planning Areas (CPAs, of which there are 33) or Periodic Use Area (PUAs; 23 of them overlap with CPAs), where coordination with federal incumbents will be required. In all but two of them, winners of 3.45 GHz licenses have to coordinate operations across all 100 megahertz of the band. NTIA has published federal incumbents’ transition plans and a workbook to guide coordination within the band.One thing that does appear to be clear: The table stakes spectrum for successfully providing 5G services involve a far higher amount of spectrum and at least some of it needs to be midband. As AT&T put it in its FCC filing: “Ten years ago, providers such as MetroPCS and Leap could provide competitive, high-performing mainstream wireless services with 20 megahertz of paired spectrum in just a few markets. Today … providers will need 80-100 megahertz of contiguous mid-band spectrum to provide the full benefits of 5G to their customers. And demand for more such spectrum will only escalate as the new 5G ecosystem generates more bandwidth-intensive applications.”Looking for more insights on the midband spectrum landscape?

1905,23,2021/05,Eletimes,The Worldí»s Data Explained. How Much Weí»re Producing and Where ití»s all Stored,"Ancient humans stored information in cave paintings, the oldest we know of is over 40,000 years old. As humans evolved, the emergence of languages and the invention of writing led to detailed information being stored in various written forms, culminating with the invention of paper in China around the first century AD.The oldest printed books appeared in China between AD600 and AD900. For over a millennium, books remained the main source of information storage.Humans achieved more technological development in the past 150 years than during the previous 2,000 years. Arguably one of the most important developments in human history was the invention of digital electronics.Since the discovery of the transistor in 1947 and the integrated microchip in 1956, our society experienced a shift. In just over 50 years, we’ve achieved unprecedented computing power, wireless technologies, the internet, artificial intelligence, and advances in display technologies, mobile communications, transportation, genetics, medicine, and space exploration.Most importantly, the introduction of digital data storage also changed the way we produce, manipulate and store information. The transition point took place in 1996 when digital storage became more cost-effective for storing information than paper.Digital data storage technologies are very diverse. Most notable are magnetic storage (HDD, tape), optical discs (CD, DVD, Blu-Ray), and semiconductor memories (SSD, flash drive). Each type of memory is more useful to specific applications.Semiconductor memories are the preferred choice for portable electronics, optical storage is mostly used for movies, software, and gaming, while magnetic data storage remains the dominant technology for high-capacity information storage, including personal computers and data servers.All digital data storage technologies operate on the same principles. Bits of information can be stored in any material containing two distinctive and switchable physical states. In binary code, the digital information is stored as ones and zeroes, also known as bits. Eight bits form a byte.A logical zero or one is allocated to each physical state. The smaller these physical states are, the more bits can be packed into the storage device. The width of digital bits today is around ten to 30 nanometres (billionths of a meter). These devices are very complex because developing devices capable of storing information at this scale require controlling materials on the atomic level.Big dataDigital information has become so entrenched in all aspects of our lives and society, that the recent growth in information production appears unstoppable. Each day on Earth we generate 500 million tweets, 294 billion emails, 4 million gigabytes of Facebook data, 65 billion WhatsApp messages, and 720,000 hours of new content added daily on YouTube.In 2018, the total amount of data created, captured, copied, and consumed in the world was 33 zettabytes (ZB) – the equivalent of 33 trillion gigabytes. This grew to 59ZB in 2020 and is predicted to reach a mind-boggling 175ZB by 2025. One zettabyte is 8,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bits.To help visualize these numbers, let’s imagine that each bit is a £1 coin, which is around 3mm (0.1 inches) thick. One ZB made up of a stack of coins would be 2,550 lightyears. This can get you to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, 600 times. Currently, each year we produce 59 times that amount of data, and the estimated compound growth rate is around 61%.Data storageMost digital information is stored in three types of location. First is the global collection of what are called endpoints, which include all internet of things devices, PCs, smartphones, and all other information storage devices. The second is the edge, which includes infrastructure such as cell towers, institutional servers, and offices, such as universities, government offices, banks, and factories. Third, most of the data is stored in what’s known as the core—traditional data servers and cloud data centers.There are around 600 hyperscale data centers—ones with over 5,000 servers—in the world. Around 39% of them are in the US, while China, Japan, UK, Germany, and Australia account for about 30% of the total.The largest data servers in the world are China Telecom Data Center, in Hohhot, China, which occupies 10.7 million square feet, and The Citadel in Tahoe Reno, Nevada, which occupies 7.2 million square feet and uses 815 megawatts of power.To meet the ever-growing demand for digital data storage, around 100 new hyperscale data centers are built every two years. The recent study examined these trends and concluded that, at a 50% annual growth rate, around 150 years from now the number of digital bits would reach an impossible value, exceeding the number of all atoms on Earth. About 110 years from now, the power required to sustain this digital production will exceed the total planetary power consumption today."
1908,23,2021/05,Eletimes,New Design for Isolated Power Supply Chip,"Recently, a research group led by Prof. Cheng Lin from the School of Microelectronics, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has made achievements in the field of fully integrated isolated power chip design.The researchers proposed a chip based on a glass fan-out wafer-level package (FOWLP), achieving 46.5% peak transformation efficiency and 50mW/mm2 power density.Compared with the traditional isolated power supply chip, this new design interconnects the receiving and transmitting chips through the micro transformer made of the rewiring layer, showing no need for additional transformer chips. In this way, it lowered the need for three or even four chips in the existing chip design, so as to greatly improve the efficiency of the isolated power supply.In addition, the researchers proposed a grid voltage control technology with a variable capacitor, which maintains the grid peak voltage in the best safe voltage range even in a wider supply voltage range.This design improves the conversion efficiency and power density of the chip effectively, providing a new solution for the design of isolated power chips in the future.This work is published at the IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) and was selected as the demo demonstration at the meeting."

1925,23,2021/05,Eetasia,Automotive Radars Could Soon Face Significant Interference,"The little-noted issue of radar safety is emerging as a potential Achilles heel of driver-assist and highly automated vehicles: radar signals interfere with each other.Radar has become an essential sensing modality complementing CMOS imaging cameras. Radar works in all weather conditions and enables a range of automated driving features, including automatic emergency brakes (AEB). But radars can be foiled or faulty if they end up, like Ghostbusters’ particle accelerators, crossing each other’s streams.While this is not yet a phenomenon publicly cautioned by carmakers or commonly perceived by drivers, automotive radars, operating in congested environments, will face significant interference."

Following that announcement, the processors will go on sale in September (remember, a previous rumor suggested an August release, so this fresh speculation is pretty much in line with what came before).Mind you, the comment mentions ‘planned availability’, so as ever with these kind of leaks, even if this is indeed AMD’s plan right now, that could change and the intended timeframe could slide.RECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU...

That would be a departure from the current Threadripper (Zen 2) chips which ditched the 16-core model.Other higher core count models will still be available with Zen 3-based HEDT silicon, of course, and Threadripper 5000 is expected to maintain the same 64-cores for the flagship chip as seen in the current Threadripper 3000 family.As to how a theoretical 16-core Threadripper chip will fit in when you consider that AMD has consumer processors with that many cores, it’ll obviously flex its muscles in other ways. Remember that AMD’s HEDT platform confers further performance benefits for heavyweight computing including quad-channel RAM and more PCIe lanes.These new chips are expected to be compatible with current TRX40 motherboards, so if upgrading, you’ll be able to slot the new CPU in, and all that will be required is a firmware update.AMD has done well in terms of keeping a tight lid on next-gen Threadripper leaks thus far, but if a launch really is only a couple of months or so away, we can doubtless expect more spillage to come which will give a much better indication of how the range is shaping up, and whether there will be a more affordable 16-core HEDT chip nestling on the lowest tier.It’s not too surprising that AMD hasn’t pushed out new Threadripper processors yet, given the well-documented supply and demand issues with consumer Ryzen CPUs of late – the last thing the firm needs is having to fight another battle to meet demand on the HEDT front, with production resources already stretched as it is.Indeed, that could be the biggest stumbling block in the argument against Threadripper 5000 turning up in a few months, although AMD has said that the CPU stock situation will get better as 2021 goes on, and for that matter there are clear signs of improved availability already (but not at the lower-end).Today's best processor dealsAMD Ryzen 5 3600 ($25 off SEP)Amazon$174.99ViewIntel Core i5-10400F 6-Core...Walmart$185.99ViewAMD Ryzen 5 5600X 3.7 GHz...BHPhoto$459.98ViewShow More DealsWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesIntel vs AMD: which is best?"

As Darrell notes, some industries will see shortages into 2022, but not all. Among the biggest victims of the chip shortage have been automobile manufacturers which cut orders last year due to the pandemic, according to Harvard Business Review. This freed up a lot of capacity for IT and consumer electronics that have already locked in orders that will be rolling off the fabrication lines shortly.While this is terrible news for the automotive industry which now needs to play catch up, those chips which didn't end up in cars this year will be going into graphics cards and other computer equipment instead.

1954,25,2021/05,Techradar,Rumored MacBook Pros could use M1X chip this year ¿C with M2 coming in 2022.,"Apple’s next MacBook Pro refresh, which could be due later this year – perhaps in the summer, going by the latest from the rumor mill – might come with a pepped-up version of Apple’s own silicon called the M1X.The M1X label has been kicking around for a while now – in fact ever since the M1 came out, and speculation started about its successor – and it’ll supposedly be present in these inbound MacBook Pros, as opposed to an M2 chip. The M2 model is purportedly being saved for 2022, and could arrive in a new MacBook Air next year (grab your buckets of condiments now – we’re not sure how much sense an Air debut would make for starters).Check out all the best laptops aroundAnd the best Macs to buy this yearAmazon’s Prime Day 2021 sale is on the horizonAt any rate, this is the claim from an iOS developer and Apple leaker on Twitter as flagged up by 9 to 5 Mac, with @dylandkt claiming: “The M1X is an extension of the M1 that will contain more thunderbolt channels, CPU cores, GPU cores, multiple external monitor support, and greater power draw. These devices will both feature a 1080p webcam, SD card reader, three thunderbolt USB C ports, an updated MagSafe port, and an HDMI port.”9 to 5 Mac reckons that @dylandkt is a source with a solid enough track record when it comes to leaking, and they do seem to have got some things right in the past looking at some previous tweets. But that said, this isn’t one of the go-to reliable Apple leakers, so we’d be very cautious about taking this at face value.RECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU...Furthermore, 9 to 5 Mac observes that this rumor arguably marries up (at least in some fashion) with a fresh leak from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg, namely that the new MacBook Pros supposedly due out in the summer will be built with a chip along the same lines as the existing M1, but with more cores. 10-cores in fact (with 8 of them being performance cores, plus 2 power-efficient ones), instead of the M1’s 8-cores (with 4 performance cores). Gurman did not mention that this will be an M1X model, though, or give it a name at all.Trying to draw together two rumors like this – which both need to be regarded with skepticism, particularly this new one as we’ve already touched on – is something of a questionable pursuit, of course.M1X in more Macs?It seems that @dylandkt has put forward the idea of the M1X being inbound for the MacBook Pro 14-inch and 16-inch refreshes before, too (previous to Gurman’s speculation), with the developer contending that M1X will also come to a ‘higher-end iMac’ as well as a ‘higher-end Mac mini’.As ever, only time will tell, and indeed that’s the case for whether the refreshed MacBook Pro models are actually in the pipeline for the near future, as another recent bit of buzz from the grapevine claimed that they could be delayed until 2022 (which isn’t an entirely unbelievable prospect considering other whispers from the rumor mill about component shortages possibly affecting MacBook production).Finally, it’s worth noting a further snippet from @dylandkt about these incoming Apple laptops which claims that the ‘MacBook Pro’ logo will be removed (and the bezels will be thinner – all part of allowing a bigger screen to fit in the chassis). These MacBook Pro models are, of course, expected to use Mini LED screens like the new iPad Pro 12.9.Shop all the latest MacBook Pro deals and sales"

This suggests that its phones will not only get a serious bump in processing power but Samsung could be turning its suite of devices into a more unified platform.That unified approach has been employed by Apple for some time, and with its M1 chip already making the reverse jump from MacBooks to the iPad Pro, it might not be long before we see M1 powered iPhones.

However, with Half-Double, we have observed Rowhammer effects propagating to rows beyond adjacent neighbors, albeit at a reduced strength,” write the researchers in Google’s Security blog.The researchers also reveal that Google has been working with the JEDEC semiconductor engineering trade organization, and several other manufacturers from the industry to search for possible solutions for this new Rowhammer attack.In fact, the Google researchers refer to Rowhammer as a “substantial” challenge with far-reaching ramifications.

2029,25,2021/05,Techradar,iPhone 13í»s A15 chip is likely in production - here's why that matters,"A new report suggests that Apple’s supplier of mobile silicon, TSMC, has started production of the A15 chipsets set to be used in the upcoming iPhone 13 range. That could mean the phones are on schedule to release in September. That’s been in question: the global chip shortage has been predicted to last into late 2022, and a report has suggested that it will affect supply of Apple’s new MacBooks and iPads – and while the latter rumor said iPhones weren’t likely to be affected, last year’s iPhone 12 was reportedly impacted by component shortages.For now, however, it looks like it's all systems go. The new report comes courtesy of DigiTimes, which also claims that demand for the A15 Bionic chipset will be greater in scale than the A14 that was in the iPhone 12 range. That suggests Apple is expecting even greater sales for its next flagship phones. And if the A15 chipsets are starting production, that suggests the iPhone 13 could come out during Apple’s usual September release window for its flagship phones.Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksForge of Empires - Free Online GameIf You Spend Time on Your Computer, this Vintage Game is a Must-Have.

A supposed dummy unit suggests the final version will have a smaller notch, though still not a switch to a punch-hole for its front-facing cameras. And that’s just the aesthetics side – the iPhone 13 Pro models are also predicted to get a 120Hz refresh rate on its displays, though it’s unclear if that will be extended to the standard and potential mini models. Stay on top of tech news with the TechRadar newsletter"
2021,25,2021/05,Eetasia,What the Next 10 Years Could Look Like for Arm v9,"About a month ago, Arm announced its next generation of architecture — V9. For the time being, the eighth iteration of the Arm architecture (ARMv8) is the most advanced architecture in the wild of system-on-chip (SoC) devices. We can expect a few leading SoC companies to begin the transition over the next year or so.Since the v8 architecture was the mainstay for a decade, it will be interesting to look back to those early days in order to attempt to look forward at what some future v9 devices might look like over its lifespan.X-File"
2085,26,2019/05,RCR,Huawei spent years preparing for US ban. Report,"Chinese vendor Huawei has been preparing for years for the scenario of a ban which would not allow the company to buy components from U.S companies, according to a report by CNN Business.“This decision [the ban] is the latest move in the campaign against Huawei, waged by the U.S. government for political reasons,” Huawei’s rotating Chairman Ken Hu wrote in a memo to employees.“The company has known
this could be a possibility for many years,” the executive said. “We
have invested heavily and made full preparations in a variety of areas.”Huawei acquired $70 billion worth of components and parts last year from 13,000 suppliers. Of that, about $11 billion was spent on products from dozens of U.S. businesses, including computer chips from Qualcomm and Broadcom, as well as Microsoft software and Google’s Android, according to the report.Huawei’s chip designsubsidiary
HiSilicon also said it had been preparing for this “extreme situation for
survival.”In an internal memo seen by CNN Business, HiSilicon chief He Tingbo said the company had assumed that “one day, all advanced chips and technologies in the U.S. will not be available.”She added that HiSilicon had created “spare tires” to enable the company to continue to serve customers. “Today, as history has made the choice, the spare tires we built have turned in to ‘Plan A’ overnight,” she added. Earlier this week, the U.S. Department of Commerce confirmed that it is adding Chinese vendor Huawei Technologies and 70 affiliates to its so-called “Entity List”, a decision that effectively bans Huawei from buying parts and components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.Under the order, which is expected to take effect once it is published in the Federal Register, Huawei will need a U.S. government license to buy components from U.S suppliers. The DoC said that a license may be denied if the sale or transfer would harm U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.“This could
set back Huawei’s supply chain in the US and potentially delay 5G in
China,” Edison Lee and Timothy Chau, analysts with brokerage firm
Jefferies, said in a note.Beyond China, the vendor has already
signed several commercial 5G contracts around the world, including 25 in Europe
and 10 in the Middle East."
2044,26,2019/05,axios,World GOP senator's new bill would crack down on U.S. tech going to China,"A bill announced Tuesday by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) would make it harder for American companies to export major emerging technologies to China.Why it matters: Technology, from AI to 5G wireless, has become a major bargaining chip in the broader tensions between the U.S. and China.Details: The bill would require the president to restrict exports to China of any technology covered by the law, including...""Technology or intellectual property that would make a significant contribution to the military potential"" of China.IP or technology that is required to guard the U.S. economy from ""the excessive drain of scarce materials and to reduce the serious inflationary impact of demand from the People's Republic of China.""Tech that the secretary of state says is being used by the Chinese government to violate human rights.Technology whose development is supported by the Chinese government or that falls under a broad list of covered industries, influencing artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing and robotics.Our thought bubble: A broad range of products could be affected, though the restrictions it envisions, such as licensing, wouldn't necessarily ban the exports outright. If the bill picks up legislative steam and passes, the details of its implementation would be key."
2099,26,2019/05,RCR,Judge rules that Qualcomm í«strangled competitioní»,"A U.S. district court judge has found that Qualcomm violated anti-trust laws, ruling in favor of the Federal Trade Commission and ordering Qualcomm to change some of its licensing and negotiation practices and seven years of monitoring and reporting on its compliance.Qualcomm has said publicly that it plans to appeal.“We strongly disagree with the judge’s conclusions, her interpretation of the facts and her application of the law,” general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement to Reuters.The FTC sued Qualcomm in 2017 over its trade practices. In a 233-page ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh wrote that “Qualcomm’s licensing practices have strangled competition in the CDMA and premium LTE modem chip markets for years, and harmed rivals, OEMs, and end consumers  in the process” — including undermining the development of the WiMAX ecosystem supported by Intel. And the company continues to engage in anticompetitive conduct, she wrote.“Qualcomm continues to refuse to provide patent exhaustion, refuse to sell modem chips to an OEM until the OEM signs a license, and engage in chip supply threats and cutoffs … and continues to withhold chip supply as leverage against OEMs,” Koh wrote, citing the example of Apple challenging Qualcomm’s royalty rates and Qualcomm responding by refusing to supply chips for 2018 iPhone models. (The companies have since settled their litigation and signed a new, multi-year supplier agreement.)Koh noted that in addition to the FTC action, regulatory agencies around the world — including in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China and the European Union — have investigated and/or taken action against the company for its trade practices.In setting out new rules under which Qualcomm must operate, the judge took into consideration both the current market and the one developing for 5G. Her ruling cited internal Qualcomm documents which lay out the company’s position that technology transitions — such as the current transition to 5G — create significant returns for Qualcomm, with the company documenting that its revenues more than doubled during the 3G to 4G transition and estimating that its lead on key competitors in the 5G space was between 12 to 24 months. Meanwhile, documents from OEMs such as Motorola demonstrated concerns that the significant technology gap would mean that Qualcomm’s market dominance would be maintained in 5G.“There is sufficient likelihood that Qualcomm will hold monopoly power in the 5G modem chip market such that exclusive dealing agreements for the supply of modem chips could foreclose competition in that emerging market,” Koh concluded.As a remedy, Koh ordered that Qualcomm make a series of changes in its trade practices, including not conditioning the supply of modem chips on a customer’s patent license status and renegotiating patent license agreements on terms that “reflect the fair value of Qualcomm’s patents” — but the company is prohibited from threatening a lack of, or discriminatory, access to chips and related support as part of those negotiations. Qualcomm must also make “exhaustive [standard essential patent] licenses available” to competing modem-chip suppliers, and it will be prohibited from entering expressly or de facto exclusive deals for modem chip supply — so it can’t undercut a device OEM’s efforts to source those components elsewhere, thereby cutting its rivals out of the market. In some cases, the judge wrote, Qualcomm has made deals that required OEMs such as Samsung to buy 100% of its premium modem chips in a given year; such deals would be prohibited.  "
2105,26,2019/05,RCR,Google suspends some business with Huawei following U.S order. Report,"Google has suspended the transfer of hardware, software and technical services to Chinese vendor Huawei following a recent order by the U.S. government to put Huawei in an export blacklist, Reuters reported, citing a source familiar with the matter.The U.S. giant said that it will only continue offering those services publicly available via open source licensing.“Huawei
will only be able to use the public version of Android and will not be able to
get access to proprietary apps and services from Google,” the source said.The
source also said that the details of the specific services affected by the
suspension were still being discussed internally at Google.“We are complying with the order and reviewing the implications,” a Google spokesperson reportedly said. “For users of our services, Google Play and the security protections from Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices,” the spokesperson added.Also, U.S. chipmakers including Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx and Broadcom have told their employees they will not supply Huawei until further notice, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter. Last week, the U.S. Department of Commerce confirmed that it is adding Chinese vendor Huawei to its so-called “Entity List”, a decision that effectively bans the Chinese company from buying parts and components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.The decision was adopted amid a recent escalation in the trade war between the the U.S. and China.Under the order, Huawei will need a U.S. government license to buy components from U.S suppliers. The DoC said that a license may be denied if the sale or transfer would harm U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.“Huawei has made substantial contributions to the development and growth of Android around the world. As one of Android’s key global partners, we have worked closely with their open-source platform to develop an ecosystem that has benefitted both users and the industry,” Huawei said in a statement.“Huawei will continue to provide security updates and after-sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products, covering those that have been sold and that are still in stock globally.”Earlier this year, Huawei Technologies confirmed that it has a proprietary operating systems for both smartphones and computers, which the vendor plans to use in the event of an eventual ban by the U.S. government.Huawei started
building its own operating system after a U.S. investigation into Huawei and
compatriot vendor ZTE in 2012, according to previous reports.Huawei’s
mobile chief Richard Yu Chengdong
had said that Huawei has made a backup OS for PCs and smartphones in the event
that the increasing tensions with the U.S. government prevent the vendor from
using Windows and Android."
2106,26,2019/05,Eetasia,"Judge Bans Qí»commí»s í░no license, no chipsí▒ policy","Qualcomm must end its “no license, no chips” policy and renegotiate all of its existing licenses for cellular patents, a San Jose judge ruled. The 233-page decision will impact virtually all cellular chip and systems vendors on the cusp of a transition to 5G.Judge Lucy Koh also ruled that Qualcomm cannot enter any exclusive licensing deals, essentially invalidating its recent landmark deal with Apple. In addition, it must license its standards-essential patents (SEPs) to chip rivals and let the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) monitor its licensing practices for seven years.If it stands, the ruling could slash billions of dollars off of Qualcomm’s existing and future licensing revenues. Qualcomm said that it will seek an immediate stay of the ruling and an expedited appeal."
2112,26,2019/05,TechCruch,Huawei bars staff from having technical meetings with US contacts,"Huawei bars staff from having technical meetings with US contactsManish Singh@refsrc / 5:11 PM GMT+8•May 31, 2019comment CommentcameraImage Credits: HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP / Getty ImagesReeling from the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, Chinese technology giant Huawei has found itself in yet another dilemma: How to pursue internal communications with its own U.S. employees? For now, the company has ordered its Chinese employees to bar technical meetings with their U.S. contacts and sent home the American workers deployed in research and development functions in Shenzhen headquarters.Dang Wenshuan, Huawei’s chief strategy architect, told the Financial Times that the company has also limited general communications between its Chinese and U.S. workers. The move comes as the Chinese technology giant scrambles to comply with the murky laws after its weeks-long tension with the U.S. government sees no signs of resolution in the immediate future.The Chinese giant is also controlling the subjects of interactions workers in its campus have with overseas visitors. The conversations cannot touch topics related to technology, the FT report said. Dang said the company was just trying to ensure it was on the right side of the law.It remains unclear exactly how export controls could mandate disruption of internal communications within an organization. Huawei could be using this tack as a bargaining chip, showing the U.S. that its own citizens are being hurt by its policies. A Huawei spokesperson declined to comment on queries sent by TechCrunch.Earlier this month, Huawei and 68 affiliates were put on an “entity list” by the U.S. Commerce Department over national security concerns, forcing American companies to take approval from the government before conducting any business with the Chinese giant. In the aftermath, a range of companies, including chipmakers, Google and Microsoft, have made significant changes to their business agreements with Huawei.In recent weeks, several Huawei executives have spoken out about the significance of the U.S. government order. In the meantime, the company has also explored ways to fight back the order. Earlier this week, Huawei filed a legal motion to challenge the U.S. ban on its equipment, calling it “unconstitutional.”At stake is the future of one of the largest suppliers of smartphones and networking equipment. A significant portion of the company’s business comes from outside of China. For smartphones, one of its core businesses, the company says it is already working on an operating system that does not rely on technologies sourced from U.S. companies. But it is yet to provide any evidence on how — and if — that operating system would function.The U.S. government earlier this month offered some relief to Huawei by granting a temporary general export license for 90 days, which allows companies such as Google to continue to provide critical support to the Chinese company for three months.
